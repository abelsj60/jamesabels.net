      'To the boy, magic seemed simple.\n\nIt was a true and honest attempt to warm the world with great stories, exciting adventures, and sparkling eyes.\n\nSo, one night, the boy slipped astride a fairy’s back and sailed across a wide blue sea. He had many grand adventures. He soared through pirate ships and never lands, kicked up sand with floating Jinns, and raced through wooden bureaus to unknown lands.\n\nAs he traveled, the boy learned to cast spells. He told the most incredible tales, and he soon found that his stories shaped life as much as life shaped his stories — magic.\n\nAnd so it was that the boy never outgrew the beginnings of his magic.'

    title: 'The boy who found magic in software',
    text:
      'The boy built software long before he learned to code.\n\nHe worked with a *fast friend to create platforms that were unlike anything that had come before them. Creativity was their strength — and their weakness.\n\nFor the boy learned, people didn’t care what software could do or what it could allow. All they saw was the story about it, and the way it was told. Technology meant little to the world, features were of marginal value, but the tale they told…that was pure magic.\n\nSo the boy learned to cast new spells, always telling better and better tales.'

      'One day, the boy decided it was time to become a full-stack software developer.\n\nSo he walked into Fullstack Academy, a coding bootcamp in New York. They gave him a book full of practical magic. It talked about front-end frameworks (React), Web servers (Express), back-end databases (Sequelize), and run-time environments (Node).\n\nFullstack taught him how to think about algorithms, gel with development teams, and teach himself about new software technologies and development techniques.\n\nThe course was intense — like riding a centaur beside Aslan into battle.'

    title: 'Software, stories, and a dash of digital magic',
    text:
      'The boy woke, a fresh future of spell casting and tale telling before him.\n\nThere were software platforms to build, and stories to shape them. There were features to plan, and use cases to guide them. There were ideas to dream, and users to spark them. The boy smiled, as he sailed a digital sea toward a new world of adventure.\n\nThere was magic to make, and unknown lands to conquer.'
