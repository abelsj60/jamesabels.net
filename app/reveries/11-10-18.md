Unfortunately, I have a pedestal sink. I used to think this sort of
thing looked great. Then I got one. Three problems.

1. If one leans over the sink to spit after brushing teeth, it
   bounces back at you because of the flat
   bottom.

2. The sink keeps getting dirty because the flat bottom
   doesn't drain. So
   flotsam constantly accumulate wherever its
   designers swapped tradition for good press shots.

3. There's nowhere to put stuff. The pedestal has a small little
   bezzle that holds nothing. I guess it looks great on Instagram, but then again Kevin Systrom can afford to install a shelf next to
   his sink.
