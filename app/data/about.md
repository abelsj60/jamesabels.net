James Abels is a NYC-based Web developer.

He's available to work on a range of front- and back-end technology projects, particularly those that require story telling and creative narratives for consumers.

A lawyerÂ and former start-up founder, Abels spent several years as a staff reporter for Forbes.com and Mergermarket. He covered the cutting edge of technology, venture capital and digital media. If he were writing about next-gen tech today, he'd focus on voice assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, because they've opened a frontier close enough to touch and real enough to enjoy.

Abels is currently working with Upendra Shardanand on a new media product built around Facebook Messenger. It's slated to launch in 2019.
