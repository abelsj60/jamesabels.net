      National Public Radio has seen its share of shake-ups lately, including
      the departure of chief executive Ken Stern in March. Soon after, an NPR
      journalist reported the reason was a failure "to convince the board where
      local stations fit into the digital age, when listeners can bypass
      old-fashioned FM stations." Like all media, NPR — which supplies
      programming to over 860 local radio stations — is struggling with the
      results of the Internet's ability to cheaply distribute content.

      Late last month, Kinsey Wilson joined NPR as senior vice president and
      general manager of NPR Digital Media from Gannet- owned USA Today, where
      he was executive editor. One early goal: to boost NPR's traffic, which
      comScore estimates at some 2.2 million unique visitors in September.
      Forbes.com talked with him about the future of public radio and the role
      of its 38-year old affiliate network. Here's an edited version of what he
      had to say:

        Forbes.com: What attracted you to the NPR job after running Internet
        operations at USA Today?

    </p>

    <p>
      Kinsey Wilson: I think NPR is at a point where it's really poised to take
      advantage of digital. I don't think, in the long term, we can think of
      ourselves as a radio or purely as an audio news organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Do you have any examples of how that's coming along?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      We're in the process of integrating our editorial digital staff and the
      rest of the editorial staff. Dick Meyer, who heads the Digital Editorial
      Staff, reports to me and to Ellen Weiss, who is the VP for news.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        Increasing the unique visitors to NPR content is a priority online, how
        do you accomplish that?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      We've moved from being primarily destination sites to moving into an arena
      where it is all about distributed media. We've got an architecture that
      supports open distribution of our content. So you try to create a virtual
      circle between high-quality content, ease of distribution and a connection
      with audiences that inspires them to distribute links, etc. ... I think
      that's where the real opportunity for traffic growth is.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        So you are trying to work with the local affiliates digitally and not
        supplant them?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Deepening and improving our relationships with our member stations is a
      big priority. It's difficult to say exactly how technology will change the
      ways in which the content is distributed and the relationship between the
      member stations and NPR in Washington.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        If you're looking at consumer preference, the answer may not be the
        local affiliate's site. What then?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      In this environment you cannot ultimately fight the tide of consumer
      preference. I think the good news is that that's the subject of open,
      transparent, healthy conversation within the organization at this point.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>But you think there's time to figure it out?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The speed in which our business is being challenged is very different than
      that of most of our commercial brethren. It does so far have the advantage
      of not being forced to react to things in quite the same kind of time
      frame. [One reason is] our audience is growing. There is a tremendous
      opportunity for the local stations, particularly with newspapers suffering
      the kind of staff cuts and reductions that they have, to become an even
      more robust provider of news to their communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        Does NPR offer something particularly valuable to digital news
        consumers?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      [People] want analysis. I think they also want a connection with
      individuals; they want to understand something about the person that
      stands behind the news report. I think the mix of authority and
      familiarity that NPR has managed to combine on air is something that
      translates very nicely to the Web, where the traditional, formal voice of
      authority of a newspaper or even a traditional network television
      broadcast does not meet the expectations of Web readers.
