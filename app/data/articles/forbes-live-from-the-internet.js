      Some 63.2 million television viewers tuned into the presidential debate
      Tuesday night. News Corp.'s MySpace broadcast it as well. The results were
      somewhat different.

      "We think with over 100,000 views, which we've gotten every time, it's
      pretty good considering it's on every television network," says Lee
      Brenner, MySpace's executive producer of political programming.

      Optimistic spin? Sure. But while watching live news on the Web remains in
      its infancy, it is gaining ground. An ABI Research study of 985 people
      found last month that video from news sites was the second most popular
      category of Web video, with just under 70% viewing it.

      Converting that interest into live news viewership via the Internet seems
      only natural, particularly given its presence outside the home at places
      like work. And live news coverage may be a real boon to Web sites because
      the events have an instantaneous value that draws people immediately to
      them.

      "In the back of everyone's head is the thought that there's a new way to
      make money here," says Joey Faust, a software solutions consultant for
      National TeleConsultants, which builds production facilities for big media
      networks like the Fox Business Network. He says his clients are heavily
      investing in production facilities that can quickly, easily — and
      simultaneously — distribute video content via traditional networks and the
      Internet.

      News Corp. and General Electric's NBC Universal both show signs they agree
      — and that they want more online viewers than MySpace has delivered to
      date. The two networks agreed this week to feed live video coverage of the
      debates to their Hulu joint venture. Brenner says MySpace had no
      involvement in sister site Hulu's deal to showcase the debates live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hulu's broadcast was a first for the site, which in July was one of
      comScore's top 10 Web video servers (it trailed MySpace umbrella Fox
      Interactive Media in the ranking). Citing company policy, a spokesperson
      declined to say how many viewers tuned in to the show. "This is an
      experiment in thinking about if live streaming is something people truly
      want," says Hulu's Christina Lee.
    </p>
    <p>
      While MySpace is using the debate coverage to help raise its profile and
      attract more users, Hulu showed a 15- or 30-second paid ad before the
      stream started. The same will be done during next week's final debate.
      Curiously, NBC News provided the video feed this week and Fox News — also
      supplying MySpace's feed — will provide it next week. Lee would only say
      both investors offered their video feed to Hulu.

      Her company pushed the news value of the live video stream one step
      further than MySpace. It played roughly 10 minutes of NBC News' live
      editorial wrap-up after Tuesday's debate and may do the same with Fox News
      next Wednesday. For now, that may be good news for news networks looking
      to expand audiences. Hulu expects to syndicate next week's debate across
      the Internet by giving people a video player to embed on their own Web
      sites that will show it live.
    </p>

      But National TeleConsultants' Faust warns there is a flip side to the
      Web-based video syndication model these moves represent. "In this new
      media distribution model the brand is what brings you revenue," he says.
      As a result, he says media businesses like Fox News may not ultimately be
      thrilled to have its identity wrapped inside a third-party entity, even
      that of a sister company like MySpace. But with these ratings, who's
      really counting?
