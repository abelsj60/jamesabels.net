altTextBoy: "This image represents the real world where we all live. It depicts an illustrated young man at center, his hands resting on translucent keyboards, looking up into the largest of of several floating monitors. A fairy floats in the air above his left shoulder, pixie dust trailing behind her. The nine translucent monitors before them are of different sizes. The main monitor is large and occupies most of the screen. The other eight are smaller, and mostly float off to the sides. Four of the nine monitors have some computer code on them. Another world can be seen within these monitors. The young man is creating it through a mixture of imagination, code, and magic. The amount seen in this image is a function of each devices screen width. The main action is at center, with fun details revealed as the Browser window is made progressively wider, or by turning mobile devices to their landscape view."
altTextForrest: "A magical forrest illustration can be seen within the monitors into which the young man and pixie look. This background illustration is the first world users see when loading the site. It's seen beneath the monitors into which the young man and pixie look. Glowing crystals float besie the blue-purple trees that frame the left and right sides of the scene. In the center sits a large tree trunk. It splits in two, growing upwards in a great U shape, like a tuning fork. A great old magical stone portal is held aloft between them, its inner circle divided into individual stone blocks. Each block has a rune of code carved into it. Glowing balls of light fill the air, while the space immediately inside the portal glows a hazy yellow-ish green."
altTextNyc: "A reddish-yellow illustration of the New York City skyline can be seen within the boy's foreground monitors after users successfully cast a spell by clicking five active Charms. These Charms are accessed by clicking the name on the home page. The image showcases the Empire State Building just off-center toward teh right side of the image. The sun casts a bright yellow ball of light behind 34th Street's famous anchor point. New York's skyscrapters are drawn into place through a variety of textures. Some have smooth sides, some have verticle or horizontal lines on them, and still others are given form in the image via diagonal screens of pink and yellow dots. Many of the buildings include glowing windows. It's dusk, and the sun if casting the sky in crimson-yellow hues."
altTextBoyBlurred: "This image is a blurred version of the normal foreground image. It featuers an illustrated young man, working on two translucent keyboards, a fairy floating above his left shoulder. Both characters are looking up into a set of nine translucent monitors. They show a background image beneath them. By default, the background illustration shows an old magical forrest. A second background image, a crimson-yellow NYC skyline, is seen after users cast a spell on the home page by clicking five active Charms in a row. Charms are accessed by clicking the name on the home page. This blurred image is used to occupy user attention while the site loads, and to mask the foreground image on very short or narrow screens. When shown on load, it reveals the unblurred version beneath it by fading out of view."
altTextForrestBlurred: "This image is a blurred version of the normal forrest image. It features a blurred version of the magical old forrest, which is made up of blue-purple trees, a magical sone portal with runes of code adorning its inner circle's edges, and crystals, floating in the air beside small glowing orbs. This image is used for two reasons. First, it occupies user attention while the site loads, fading out of view to reveal the unblurred version of it as it goes. Second, it's shown while users are casting spells in order to focus attention on the Charms they must select, as opposed to the magical forrest beneath them."
altTextNycBlurred: "This image is a blurred version of the normal New York City skyline image. It features a blurred version of the city's skyline, which is made up of artistically illustrated buildings. Each building's walls are smooth, or full of horizontal or vertical lines. Some buildings are given shape by diagonal screens of dots. Many have glowing windows. The sky is a yellow-pink hue, cast from a bright sun that has begun to set behind the Empire State Building, which is found at center left. This image is shown while users are casting a spell to return to the magical forrest. It focuses attention on the Charms that are used to cast spells, not the skyline that otherwise sits beneath the foreground monitors."
altTextForrestFallback: "This image is a very blurred version of the old magical forrest. It is stored in Browser memory and is shown on mobile devices to hide the fact that mobile Browsers may not instantly load the home page images when users navigate to home from any other page of the site."
altTextNycFallback: "This image is a very blurred version of the New York City skyline. It is stored in Browser memory and is shown on mobile devices to hide the fact that mobile Browsers may not instantly load the home page images when users navigate to home from any other page of the site. This image is only used after the user has cast a first spell, leaving the old magical forrest for home on the home page."
