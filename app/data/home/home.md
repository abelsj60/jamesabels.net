altTextBoy: "This image represents the real world where we all live. It depicts an illustrated young man at center, his hands resting on translucent keyboards, looking up into the largest of of several floating monitors. A fairy floats in the air above his left shoulder, pixie dust trailing behind her. The nine translucent monitors before them are of different sizes. The main monitor is large and occupies most of the screen. The other eight are smaller, and mostly float off to the sides. Four of the nine monitors have some computer code on them. Another world can be seen within these monitors. The young man is creating it through a mixture of imagination, code, and magic. This image is always full height and width, the device it's seen on will automaticaly crop the sides based on the screen's width. The main action is at center, with fun detail revealed as the Browser window/device width widens either by turning making the window larger or by turning the device to a landscape view."
altTextForrest: "An illustration of a magical forrest can be seen within the monitors into which the young man and pixie look. Users always see this forrest, which sits beneath the monitors into which the young man and pixie look, in the background when visiting the site. The forrest is fantastic. Glowing crystals float beside the blue-purple trees that frame the left and right sides of the scene. A large tree trunk sits in the center, it splits in two, growing upwards in a great big U shape, like a tuning fork. A big, old magical stone portal is held within the U. The portal's inner circle is divided into individual stone blocks, each with a rune of code carved into it. Glowing balls of light fill the air, while the space immediately inside the portal glows a hazy yellow-ish green."
altTextNyc: "A reddish-yellow illustration of the New York City skyline can be seen within the boy's foreground monitors after users successfully cast a spell by clicking a sequence of five active Charms. These Charms are accessed by clicking the name on the home page. The sky is cast in crimson-yellow light. The Empire State Building sits just to the left of the image's center, a ball of the sun's bright yellow ball shining behind its famous spire. New York's skyscrapers are sketched into view via a variety of textures. Some have smooth sides, some vertical or horizontal lines, and others diagonal rows of pink and yellow dots. Many of the buildings include glowing windows."
altTextBoyBlurred: "This image is a blurred version of the foreground image that features the boy, fairy, and translucent monitors. This image is only shown on very narrow screens when users are casting a spell by clicking on the Charms that appear after clicking the name on the home page. Like the un-blurred version, it features an illustrated young man, working on two translucent keyboards and a fairy floating above his left shoulder. Both characters look up toward a set of nine translucent monitors. They show a background image beneath them. By default, the background illustration shows an old magical forrest. A second background image, a crimson-yellow NYC skyline, is seen after users cast a spell on the home page by clicking a sequence of five active Charms. This blurred image is used to occupy user attention while the site loads, and to mask the foreground image on very short or narrow screens."
altTextForrestBlurred: "This image is a blurred version of the forrest background. It features a blurred version of the magical old forrest, which is made up of blue-purple trees, a magical stone portal with runes of code adorning its inner circle's edges, and crystals that float in the air beside small glowing orbs. This image is shown while users are casting spells in order to focus thier attention on the Charms, as opposed to the magical forrest beneath them."
altTextNycBlurred: "This image is a blurred version of the normal New York City skyline image. It features a blurred version of the city's skyline, which is made up of artistically illustrated buildings. Each building's walls are smooth, or full of horizontal or vertical lines. Some buildings are given shape by diagonal screens of dots. Many have glowing windows. The sky is a yellow-pink hue, cast from a bright sun that has begun to set behind the Empire State Building, which is found at center left. This image is shown while users are casting a spell to return to the magical forrest. It focuses attention on the Charms that are used to cast the spell."
altTextForrestFallback: "This image is a very blurred version of the old magical forrest. It is stored in Browser memory and is shown on the home page's first load, as well as on mobile devices to hide the fact that the browser may not instantly load home-page images when users navigate their from any other page of the site."
altTextNycFallback: "This image is a very blurred version of the New York City skyline. It is stored in Browser memory and is shown on mobile devices to hide the fact that that the browser may not instantly load home-page images when users navigate their from any other page of the site. This image is only used after the user has cast a first spell, leaving the old magical forrest for home on the home page."
