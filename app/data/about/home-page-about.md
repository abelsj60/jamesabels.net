I'm a Web developer, lawyer, and former start-up founder. I used to write about technology, digital media, and M&A as a staff reporter for Forbes and Mergermarket. 

Now I write code for consumer technology projects with creative narratives. For instance, one client is building a new type of media product for Facebook Messenger.
