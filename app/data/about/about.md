I write code for Web sites and software. I tell stories, too. 
 
That's important. Stories define everything. Consider this:

1. Microsoft sells Word by telling people they can write things with it.
    * That pitch is a story.

2. People use Word to collect and organize their thoughts. 
    * Those thoughts are a story.

3. Word saves these thoughts to a 'document'. 
    * That file name tells a story.

It's all stories, all the way down. 

That's where I come in. Rather than just mechanically coding sites and software, I try to figure out — and keep sight of — the stories driving them. I always have.

As a start-up founder, I told stories to pitch our software. As a reporter for Forbes, Mergermarket, and others, I wrote stories that gave insight into technology and venture capital. And as a lawyer, I told stories that made legal arguments. 

So that's my story. Now tell me yours!
