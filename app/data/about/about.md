altImageText: "A young teenage boy with big brown eyes stands in front of a textured yellow background. Left hand on hip, he wears a loose fitting mint-green sweatshirt with dark circles ringing each bicep, dark blue jeans, and light green 3/4-top Converse sneakers. A magic fairy floats above his left shoulder, fairy dust glittering around her."

I write code for websites and software. I tell stories, too.

That's important. I don't just mechanically code software. I figure out, and keep sight of,Â the stories that drive it. Stories have always been a touchstone for me.

As a start-up founder, I pitched our software through stories. As a staff reporter for Forbes and Mergermarket, I explored the connection between media, technology, and venture capital through stories. And, as a lawyer, I made legal arguments for clients through stories. It really is all about stories for me, from start to finish. 

So tell me, what's yours?
