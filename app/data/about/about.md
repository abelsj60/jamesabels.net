Hi! I'm James. 

I write code for Web sites and software. I tell stories, too. 
 
That's important. Stories are how we tell people about ourselves, our products and services, and the world writ large. Stories define everything, especially software. Consider this example:


1. Microsoft sells Word by telling people they can write things with it.
    * That pitch is a story.

2. People write things in Word in order to collect their thoughts. 
    * Those thoughts are a story.

3. Word saves people's thoughts inside a 'document'. 
    * That file name tells a story.

It's all stories, all the way down. 

That's where I come in. Rather than just mechanically coding sites and software, I try to figure out — and keep sight of — the stories driving them. I always have.

As a start-up founder, I told stories that pitched what we'd built. As a journalist for Forbes and others, I wrote stories that gave insights into tech, digital media, and venture capital. And as a lawyer, I told stories that made legal arguments. 

That's my story! What's yours?
