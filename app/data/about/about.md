altImageText: "A young teenage boy with big brown eyes stands in front of a textured yellow background. Left hand on hip, he wears a loose fitting mint-green sweatshirt with dark circles ringing each bicep, dark blue jeans, and light green 3/4-top Converse sneakers. A magic fairy floats above his left shoulder, fairy dust glittering around her."

I write code for Web sites and software. I tell stories, too.

That's important. It means I don't just mechanically code software. I try to figure out — and keep sight of — the stories that drive it. I always have.

As a start-up founder, I told stories that pitched our software. As a staff reporter for Forbes and Mergermarket, I wrote stories that gave insight into technology and venture capital. And, as a lawyer, I crafted stories that made legal arguments. 

Like I said — all stories, all the way down. 

So. What's yours?
