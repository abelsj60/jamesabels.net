I'm James. I'm a Web developer. I tell stories, too.

Don't you? Stories are how you tell people about yourself, your products and services, and the world writ large. Stories define everything, especially software. 

Consider this example:

1. Microsoft sells Word by telling people they can write documents with it. 
    That pitch is a story.  

2. People write documents in Word in order to collect their thoughts. 
    Those thoughts are a story.

3. Once done, people decide whether to share their document. 
    Their reason is a story.

It's all stories, all the way down. 

That's where I come in. Rather than just mechanically coding sites and software, I try to figure out — and keep sight of — the stories driving them. I always have.

As a lawyer, I told stories that made legal arguments. As a start-up founder, I told stories that pitched what we'd built. And as a journalist for Forbes and others, I wrote stories that gave insights into tech, digital media, and venture capital. 

So that's my story. What's yours?
