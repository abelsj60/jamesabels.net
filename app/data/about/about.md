I write code for Web sites and software. I tell stories, too.

That's important. It means I don't just mechanically code software. I try to figure out — and keep sight of — the stories that drive it. I always have.

As a start-up founder, I told stories that pitched our software. As a staff reporter for Forbes and Mergermarket, I wrote stories that gave insight into technology and venture capital. And, as a lawyer, I crafted stories that made legal arguments. 

Like I said — all stories, all the time. 

So. What's yours?
