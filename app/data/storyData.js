      'Magic was real to the wide-eyed boy.\n\nAnd why not? It was an honest way to delight people.\n\nSo, one night, when a fairy flew through an upstairs window, the boy fearlessly grabbed her hand. She looked at him delightedly, then carried her new friend across a wide blue sea toward home, a magical land of grand adventure. The boy played with his tiny companion for many years, soaring between pirate ships, kicking up sand with powerful Jinns, and racing through unknown lands.\n\nHis tales grew more amazing as he went.\n\nShort and sweet or long and labored, the boy learned that a good story shaped life as much as life shaped a good story. Magic.\n\nBut, one day, the boy felt blue. It was time to go home. His tiny, magical friend was very sad.',

      'The little sprite watched the boy from afar.\n\nShe saw many adventures. He grew, became a lawyer, then a journalist. He wrote about digital media and technology, and looked as though he again flew among the stars.\n\nBefore long, dreams carried him to his own company, and a new friend who coded the software he imagined. They built platforms unlike others — one that controlled online networks of interactive video with the specificity and sophistication of NBC, and one that let startup founders choreograph worldwide software demos as if directing a Broadway Show.\n\nBut, the fairy sighed. The boy forgot  the story told about technology, not its capabilites, was what really mattered.\n\nThat was the magic.',

      'The wee fairy watched the boy turn over every stone, forever telling better tales about his software.\n\nAnd while many listened, the boy finally decided it was time for something new.\n\nThe fairy danced for joy when he decided to become a software developer. The boy applied to a coding bootcamp in New York, where he was given a book full of practical magic. It held powerful, unintelligible words — React, Express, Node.js, and Sequelize.\n\nBut the school, Fullstack Academy, taught him what they meant and how to write spells with them. It taught how to think about algorithms, gel with development teams, and learn about new software technologies on his own.\n\nIt was intense. The school reminded the boy of riding with Aslan into battle. The boy felt new fire. His friend swooned.',

      "One night, the pixie swooped into the boy's room.\n\nHe was sleeping soundly beneath her. She flitted above him, head to toe, twinkling dust trailing beneath her.\n\nThe boy woke with a sneaze and looked out his open window. Dawn was stretching across the sky, drenching the city's spires in warm, bright light. As he got ready, the boy felt as though he'd been with an old friend all night, casting spells and telling tales. He grabbed his laptop and headed out. There were stories to shape, platforms to build, and magic to make.\n\nHigh above, a small figure smiled and cheered. There went a boy who still believed in magic. Then she turned toward home and sailed on for new adventure.",
