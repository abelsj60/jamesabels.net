  bio:
    "James Abels is a NYC-based Web developer.\n\nHe's available to work on a range of front- and back-end technology projects, particularly those involving story-telling and creative narratives for the mass market.\n\nA lawyerÂ and former start-up founder, Abels spent several years as a staff reporter for Forbes.com and mergermarket, where he covered the cutting edge of technology, venture capital, and digital media. If he were still covering next-gen media for big media outlets, he'd focus on voice assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, because they've opened a frontier close enough to touch and real enough to enjoy. Abels is currently working with Upendra Shardanand on a new media project that relies on Facebook Messenger, due for launch in 2019."
