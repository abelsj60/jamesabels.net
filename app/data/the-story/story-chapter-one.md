The cardboard fort collapsed to the floor.

A small fairy destroyed it after zipping through the wide-eyed boy's window with all the force of a cannonball. 

"Want to find a magic lamp," she asked, beaming as she floated eye-level.

"Of course," he said. "What do I do?"

She laughed the sound of shells crashing ashore. Then she took his hand and flew them over the moon toward home — a land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched for the lamp, soaring over pirate ships and chasing Jinns across sun-drenched sands. By night, they told amazing stories about big adventures. 

Late one night, the fairy sighed. 

"You're growing up," she said. "Time to go back." 

The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked twice on the floor between them. A secret door opened. She dove in, disappearing for what seemed like hours. The boy's eyes were heavy when she flew out, clutching the very thing they'd sought — a little gold lamp, etched by purple incantations. 

"The adventure," she said, "matters most." 

Then she read a spell aloud. "In bright day or black night, through tall tale and purple light, rub me twice and release my might, if..." 

Too late. He was out.
