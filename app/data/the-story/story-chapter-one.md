title: 'A magic quest'
description: "This illustration depicts chapter one. A fairy is floating just off center, hands outstretched, fingers pointing downward. A golden lamp, etched with runes, floats before her. It's glowing, and hovers just beyond a young boy's fingertips. He looks upon it, jaw agape, in wonder. The fairy has dark black hair, with a single streak of white, and eyes that glow a light metallic blue. She's beaming and is dressed in a simple white top and purple leggings. The calves and feet are seem to glow with white strips of electricity. Her four wings — two long, two short — feature long, sharp, glowing blue veins. They follow the wing's angular contours with sharp turns and end in small open circles. Glowing white-yellow fairy dust twinkles all around her. The boy, who's mouth hangs open, is wearing a mint green hooded sweatshirt. It has yellow and white stripes on it. The two are inside a cozy wooden treehouse. A sky full of stars is spied through a magical door that's opened just behind the pair. The room is warm and friendly and full of mystery. To their left hangs a yellow and purple paper lantern. A squat, two-shelf bookcase stands beneath it and a big, upholstered brown chair stands in front of it. It's draped by a blue blanket. A blue rug stretches under the chair, an open book upon it. To the pair's right hang two bookshelves. They're full of books, a wild green plant, bottles, and a thick well-worn white candle that's dripping with wax. A boat's steering wheel is leaning against the wall beneath them."

The stylish little fairy was too much for the wide-eyed boy. 

She zipped through his window, plowing into his cardboard fort with all the force of a cannonball. A neon streak still twinkled behind her as she dusted herself off, looking him up and down, nodding. Apparently satisfied, she flew close.

"Want to find a magic lamp," she asked, ignoring the destruction.

The boy was much too delighted to care about his ruined fort.

"YES," he shrieked, bouncing up and down. "What do I do?"

A wide grin spread across the sprite's bright face, filling the room with magic. 

She darted downward as the boy began to float, racing to grab his hand before he could settle back to earth. Out the window they went, into warm night air, flying high over the moon toward her home — a magical land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched for the magic lamp, soaring over pirate ships, chasing Jinn across sun-drenched sands. And by night, they told amazing stories about the day's big adventures, competing always to tell taller tales. 

It was wonderful.

Then, one evening, the fairy sighed. 

"You're growing up," she said. "Time to take you home." 

The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked on the floor. 

A secret door opened behind them, stars within reach on the other side.

The little sprite darted through. Hours later, she whooshed back, something squat and gold floating before her. The boy's eyes, now heavy, popped wide at the sight of the very thing they'd sought — a magic lamp etched round with runes that glowed brightly purple. 

"You had it the whole time," he exclaimed, beating back a ferocious yawn.

She smiled as she set upon the ground to talk.

"The adventures matter most," she said. 

The wee creature gazed fondly at her young friend. Then she began to explain the lamp's great secrets. "In bright day or black night, through tall tale and purple light, rub it twice and release its might, if..." 

But the boy heard no more. He was out.
