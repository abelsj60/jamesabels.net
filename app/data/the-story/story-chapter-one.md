The cardboard fort crumbled.

A small fairy destroyed it after zipping through the wide-eyed boy's window with all the force of a cannonball. 

"Want to find a glowing purple lamp," she asked, beaming as she floated eye-level.

"Of course," he said. "What does it do?"

She laughed the sound of waves crashing ashore. Then she took his hand and flew them over the moon toward home â€” a land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched, soaring over pirate ships, chasing Jinns across sun-drenched sands. And, by night, they told amazing stories about their big adventures. 

The fairy sighed late one eve. 

"You've grown up," she said. "It's time to go home." The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked twice on the floor between them. A door opened. She dove in and flew out with the very thing they'd sought! A golden lamp, etched by purple incantations. 

"The adventure matters most," she said. 

Then she began to read one of its spells aloud. "OK," she said. "The lamp'll glow purple as long..." It was too late. 

He was out.
