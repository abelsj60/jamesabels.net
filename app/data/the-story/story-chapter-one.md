The cardboard fort crumbled.

A small fairy destroyed it after zipping through the wide-eyed boy's window with all the force of a cannonball. 

"Want to find a glowing purple lamp," she asked, beaming as she floated eye-level.

"Of course," he said. "What does it do?"

She laughed the sound of waves crashing ashore. Then she took his hand and flew them over the moon toward home â€” a land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched, soaring over pirate ships, chasing Jinns across sun-drenched sands. And, by night, they told amazing stories about their big adventures. 

The fairy sighed late one eve. 

"You've grown up," she said. "It's time to go home." The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked twice on the floor between them. A door opened. She dove in and flew out with the very thing they'd sought! A golden lamp, etched by purple incantations. 

"The adventure matters most," she said. The boy was fading fast, so she quickly read one of the lamp's spells aloud. 

"Now this is important," she said. "The lamp's gold will glow purple as long..." 

Too late. He was out.
