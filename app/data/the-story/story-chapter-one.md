The cardboard fort crumbled.

A small fairy destroyed it after zipping through the wide-eyed boy's window with all the force of a cannonball. A neon streak twinkled behind her as she hovered amidst the mess. She looked the boy up and down, then nodded.

"Want to find a magic lamp," she asked, floating eye-level. 

The boy burst with delight.

"Of course," he shrieked. "What do I do?"

A coy grin spread across the fairy's bright face, filling the room with magic. 

It worked wonders. The boy began to float. The sprite then raced to grab his hand before he could settle back to the floor. Out the window they went, flying high over the moon toward her home — a magical land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched for the magic lamp, soaring over pirate ships and chasing Jinns across sun-drenched sands. By night, they told amazing stories about the day's big adventures, each competing to tell taller tales. It was wonderful.

Then, one night, when it was already late, the fairy sighed. 

"You're growing up," she said. "Time to go back." 

The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked twice on the floor between them. A secret door opened. She dove in, disappearing for what seemed like hours. The boy's eyes were heavy when she flew out, clutching the very thing they'd sought — a glowing gold lamp that was etched by purple incantations. 

"The adventure," she said, "matters most." 

She gazed fondly at her young friend, then read one aloud. "In bright day or black night, through tall tale and purple light, rub me twice and release my might, if..." 

Too late. He was out.
