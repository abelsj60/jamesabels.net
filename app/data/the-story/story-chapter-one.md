Magic was real to the wide-eyed boy.

And why not? It was a true and honest way to surpise and delight people.

So, one night, the boy grabbed the hand of a small fairy who darted through his window and promised to teach him great magics. She held fast, flying him across a wide blue sea toward home, a land of grand adventure.

The boy played there for many years.

As night fell, he'd tell his wee friend tales of the day's adventure. Sometimes he'd talk of soaring between pirate ships, battling one-armed bandits for friend and fortune. Other times, he'd tell how he'd tricked a Jinn into letting him save his wishes in a small golden lamp etched by purple incantation. He even stabbed the air once as he told her how he'd joined a massive animal army, marching for the fate of nine hidden realms. 

As they spoke, the boy learned the fairy's magic secret â€” good stories shape life as much as life shapes good stories.
