The cardboard fort fell to the floor.

A small fairy destroyed it as she zipped through the wide-eyed boy's window with all the force of a cannonball. 

"Want to find a magic lamp," she asked, floating eye-level. 

The boy burst with delight.

"Of course," he shreiked. "What should I do?"

A coy grin spread across the sprite's bright face, filling the room with magic. 

It separated the boy from gravity's grasp. The fairy raced — faster than light — to grab his hand before he could settle back to the floor. And out the window they went, flying high, over the moon, toward her home — a land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched for the lamp, soaring over pirate ships and chasing Jinns across sun-drenched sands. By night, they told amazing stories about big adventures. 

Then, one night, when it was already late, the fairy sighed. 

"You're growing up," she said. "Time to go back." 

The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked twice on the floor between them. A secret door opened. She dove in, disappearing for what seemed like hours. The boy's eyes were heavy when she flew out, clutching the very thing they'd sought — a glowing gold that was etched by purple incantations. 

"The adventure," she said, "matters most." 

She gazed fondly at her young friend, then read one aloud. "In bright day or black night, through tall tale and purple light, rub me twice and release my might, if..." 

Too late. He was out.
