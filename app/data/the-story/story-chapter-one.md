title: 'A magic quest'
description: "This illustration depicts chapter one. A fairy is floating just off center, hands outstretched, fingers pointing downward. A golden lamp, etched with runes, floats before her. It's glowing, and hovers just beyond a young boy's fingertips. He looks upon it, jaw agape, in wonder. The fairy has dark black hair, with a single streak of white, and eyes that glow a light metallic blue. She's beaming and is dressed in a simple white top and purple leggings. The calves and feet are seem to glow with white strips of electricity. Her four wings — two long, two short — feature long, sharp, glowing blue veins. They follow the wing's angular contours with sharp turns and end in small open circles. Glowing white-yellow fairy dust twinkles all around her. The boy, who's mouth hangs open, is wearing a mint green hooded sweatshirt. It has yellow and white stripes on it. The two are inside a cozy wooden treehouse. A sky full of stars is spied through a magical door that's opened just the pair. The room is warm and friendly and full of mystery. To thier left hangs a yellow and purple paper lantern. A squat, two-shelf bookcase stands beneath it and a big, upholstered brown chair stands in front of it. It's draped by a blue blanket. A blue rug stretches under the chair, an open book upon it. To the pair's right hang two bookshelves. They're full of books, a wild green plant, bottles, and a thick well-worn white candle that's dripping with wax. A boat's steering wheel is leaning against the wall beneath them."

The cardboard fort crumbled.

A small fairy destroyed it after zipping through the wide-eyed boy's window with all the force of a cannonball. A neon streak twinkled behind her as she hovered amidst the mess. She looked the boy up and down, then nodded.

"Want to find a magic lamp," she asked, floating eye-level. 

The boy burst with delight.

"Of course," he shrieked. "What do I do?"

A coy grin spread across the fairy's bright face, filling the room with magic. 

It worked wonders. The boy began to float. The sprite then raced to grab his hand before he could settle back to the floor. Out the window they went, flying high over the moon toward her home — a magical land of grand adventure. 

By day, they searched for the magic lamp, soaring over pirate ships and chasing Jinns across sun-drenched sands. By night, they told amazing stories about the day's big adventures, each competing to tell taller tales. It was wonderful.

Then, one night, when it was already late, the fairy sighed. 

"You're growing up," she said. "Time to go back." 

The boy began to sniffle.

She smiled kindly, then knocked twice on the floor between them. A secret door opened. She dove in, disappearing for what seemed like hours. The boy's eyes were heavy when she flew out, clutching the very thing they'd sought — a glowing gold lamp that was etched by purple incantations. 

"The adventure," she said, "matters most." 

She gazed fondly at her young friend, then read one aloud. "In bright day or black night, through tall tale and purple light, rub me twice and release my might, if..." 

Too late. He was out.
