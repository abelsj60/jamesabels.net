Magic was real to the wide-eyed boy.

And why not? It wasÂ an honest way to delight people.

So, one night, when a fairy flew through an upstairs window, the boy fearlessly grabbed her hand. She looked at him delightedly, then carried her new friend across a wide blue sea toward home, a magical land of grand adventure. The boy played with his tiny companion for many years, soaring between pirate ships, kicking up sand with powerful Jinns, and racing through unknown lands.

His tales grew more amazing as he went.

Short and sweet or long and labored, the boy learned that a good story shaped life as much as life shaped a good story. Magic.

But, one day, the boy felt blue. It was time to go home. His tiny, magical friend was very sad.
