The Six train sped through darkness.

The young man climbed out at Wall Street. Financial magicians thronged the way as he snaked through back alleys toward Hanover Square. 

A white tower soared skyward. 

"Coding school," he said. 

Eleven flights up, the young man logged into practical magic. 

Computer code covered screens across the floor. It was smart and austere, but lacked something important. 

"Purpose," he said, leaning toward the logic on screen.

When he looked up, he stared out at a city drenched in warm autumn light. A small blur zipped across the horizon. The young man smiled to himself. 

"Software is a story," he said. "Code the way to tell it."

Memories of impractical magic washed over him as code filled his screen in pixelated color. Time melted away.

Hours later, a sprite hung happily over him. He once again dreamed of far-off lands, Jinns, fairies, and desert sands just in reach of his outstretched hands.

Back home, the sprite landed astride the lamp beside him. 

Time again for adventure.
