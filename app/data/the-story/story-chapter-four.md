The boy left his window open one warm night. With a woosh, a pixie flew inside.

She smiled down at the sleeping boy. 

Dust fell beneath her. The boy woke with a sneaze, and looked out toward the last twinkles of a swiftly moving shadow. 

Dawn was reaching out, drenching the city and its spires in warm, bright light. 

The boy felt as though he'd been with an old friend, casting spells, telling tales. 

He grabbed his laptop and headed out. 

There were stories to tell, platforms to build, and magic to make. Behind him, a polished golden lamp began to glow lightly purple. 

High above, a fairy looped-de-loop as she spied the faint glow beneath. She clapped her hands, then turned toward home and more adventure. 

Behind her, there walked a boy who would forever believe in magic.
