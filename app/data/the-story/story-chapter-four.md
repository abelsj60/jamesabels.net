One night, the pixie swooped into the boy's room.

He was sleeping soundly beneath her. She flitted above him head to toe, twinkling dust trailing beneath her.

The boy woke with a sneaze and looked out his open window. Dawn was stretching across the sky, drenching the city's spires in warm, bright light. As he got ready, the boy felt as though he'd been with an old friend all night, casting spells and telling tales. He grabbed his laptop and headed out. There were stories to shape, platforms to build, and magic to make.

High above, a small figure smiled and cheered. There went a boy who still believed in magic. Then she turned toward home and sailed on for new adventure.
