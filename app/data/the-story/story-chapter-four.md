The Six train sped through darkness.

The boy climbed out at Wall Street, and snaked through back alleys to Hanover Square. Magicians thronged the way.

"Coding school," he said. 

A white tower soared skyward. The boy logged into practical magic 11 flights up. Code covered computer screens across the floor. While smart and austere, the logic lacked something important.

"Purpose," he thought.

Pixelated colors flooded the floor, stirring memories of impractical magic. "Software is a story," he said, as a blur zipped across the horizon. The city and its spires were drenched in warm autumn light. 

"Code the way to tell it," he added as he wrote a small recursive loop to screen.

That night, a fairy darted inside the boy's room as he slept. She skid to a swift stop on the dark lamp beside him. "He does believe," she cried down its spout. 

An angry blue bolt shot out. 

Then the gold grew warm and took on a purple glow...but, that's another story.
