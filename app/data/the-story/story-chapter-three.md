title: 'The reality glitch'
description: "This illustration depicts chapter three. The boy is now a young man. He stands at at the top of the illustration, just off center, facing the audience. A window is open behind him. Light gleams through it. The young man wears rectangular glasses, a forrest green sweater, and blue jeans. His mouth hangs open, a shocked smile spreading across it, as an impossible scene plays out in front of him. The audience looks into the room from and sees some of what the young man can't. The gigantic blue head of a Jinni with pointy ears and features that consist of thick blue strokes of light fills the right of the room. It's impossibly large, the size of magic. The Jinni's eyes and mouth are pinched in circles, an astonished reaction to the pinprick of pain that's just been inflicted on him by a marauding fairy. Her fist is clenched, a glowing ball of fairy dust still hanging where it struck the Jinni's nose moments before. Her other arm is pulled back, curving sharply at the elbow. She's channeled all the energy of her ferocious entrance into her fist. Her torso is still parallel to the floor, her left leg stretched out behind her, her right one tucked beneath her body, and a long dangling pink-and-purple diamond earring trails after her. Glowing metallic blue eyes stare into the Jinni's as her mouth hangs open in furious exasperation at the need to protect her young friend. She's wearing her favorite outfit, a white dress and purple leggings. The young man's full-sized bed stands on the floor beneath her, his MacBook open on top of it. An incredible scene indeed."

The young man's room twinkled one morning.

Dust, scattered high by a broom, had caught the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was soon pierced by the hollow ring of the broom as it brushed metal. 

The young man knelt to grab it.

"I forgot about you," he said, twice tracing its dusty etchings with a finger. 

The motion made him feel strangely giddy.

His instinct was true.  

Reality glitched. Clear blue rays shot between particles of dust, drawing a big blue creature to view. Its face, carved by white-blue lines of light, was taught with fury. 

"You've forgotten me," the Jinni boomed. 

"I have not," the young man shot back, holding his wits together just long enough to remember something. "I've rubbed your lamp twice, I've released your might!" 

The Jinni smiled terribly. 

Menace filled the room as blue sparks danced around the monstrous being. 

The young man tensed for an unwinnable fight.

And then the air between them blurred. A fairy was flying at breakneck speed, fist extended, ready to deliver a magical punch. It landed with an explosion of light. 

The Jinni's face tightened, then scrunched with annoyance. 

The young man — who'd watched with slack-jawed amazement — expected the Jinni's anger to slither through the room. But, it roared with laughter instead, delighted by the little fairy who now hovered eye level to scream at it. 

The young man was filled with good cheer. 

It warmed him, and a strong purple glow burst forth from the gold lamp that now lay forgotten on the floor. The colorful light seemed to drench the world in magic.

The Jinni drank of it, deeply, then struck massive hands together. Time shattered and crashed to the floor, pulling the young man down to sleep beside it. Hours later, he was awakened by the sound and fury of lightning and thunder. 

The laptop beside him glowed with a coding school's Web site.

Fate — never truly frozen — knocked.
