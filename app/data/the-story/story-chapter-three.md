The wee fairy watched the boy turn over every stone, forever telling better tales about his software.

And while many listened, the boy finally decided it was time for something new.

The fairy danced for joy when he decided to become a software developer. The boy applied to a coding bootcamp in New York, where he was given a book full of practical magic. It held powerful, unintelligible words â€” React, Express, Node.js, and Sequelize.

But the school, Fullstack Academy, taught him what they meant and how to write spells with them. It taught how to think about algorithms, gel with development teams, and learn about new software technologies on his own.

It was intense. The school reminded the boy of riding with Aslan into battle. The boy felt new fire. His friend swooned.
