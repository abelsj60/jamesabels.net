One afternoon, the boy's room twinkled.

Dust, scattered by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was pierced by the hollow ring of the broom on metal. The boy knelt to pick it up.

"I forgot about you," he said, tracing the lamp's purple etchings with a finger.

Reality glitched. The room was drenched in pixelated technicolor as clear red rays shot between free-floating sparkles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view.

"What are you doing," it boomed.

The boy sighed. "I turned over every stone," he said, shrugging. "No mas."

The Jinn leaned menacingly forward to stab at the boy with crisp blue sparks. "You've lost our secret," it bellowed.

A storm began to brew.

A fairy flit through the boy's vision. She yelled violently at the Jinn, who shrank from her sight, then turned to speak.

But the Jinn clapped hands around her, waking the boy with thunder. A coding school Web site glowed on the screen beside his still darkened magic lamp.

Fate was sealed.
