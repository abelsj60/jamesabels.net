The young man's room twinkled one morning.

Dust, scattered high by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was soon pierced by the hollow ring of the broom as it brushed metal. 

The young man knelt, reaching to grab it.

"I forgot about you," he said, twice tracing the lamp's dusty etchings with a finger. Something about the motion made him feel light and excited.

He was right to be giddy. Reality began to glitch. 

Clear red rays shot between particles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. 

"You've forgotten my secret," it boomed. Menace filled the room. 

Impulse pulled the young man toward bedsheets while pride kept him still. 

"I have not," he said, readying for a fight he couldn't win, but wouldn't duck. "I've rubbed you twice, I've released your might." The young man raised his fists.

The Jinn looked delighted. 

All seemed lost. And then a small sprite blurred to a stop between them. 

She yelled at the Jinn, banging its nose with tiny fists. The Jinn roared with laughter as the young man stared slack jawed at the impossible sight. 

A strong purple glow suddenly lit the lamp, which lay forgotton on the floor. 

It charged the room with possibility, filling the young man with hopes and dreams of anything and everything. This was magic.

The Jinn drew it in, then struck hands together, shattering time. Sleep came to the young man as it crashed to the floor. He was startled awake hours later by thunder. A coding school Web site glowed on the computer beside him. 

Fate, ever-changing, was sealed anew.
