title: 'The reality glitch'
description: "This illustration depicts chapter three. The boy is now a young man. He stands at at the top of the illustration, just off center, facing the audience. A window is open behind him. Light gleams through it. The young man wears rectangular glasses, a forrest green sweater, and blue jeans. His mouth hangs open, a shocked smile spreading across it, as an impossible scene plays out in front of him. The audience looks into the room from and sees some of what the young man can't. The gigantic blue head of a Jinni with pointy ears and features that consist of thick blue strokes of light fills the right of the room. It's impossibly large, the size of magic. The Jinni's eyes and mouth are pinched in circles, an astonished reaction to the pinprick of pain that's just been inflicted on him by a marauding fairy. Her fist is clenched, a glowing ball of fairy dust still hanging where it struck the Jinni's nose moments before. Her other arm is pulled back, curving sharply at the elbow. She's channeled all the energy of her ferocious entrance into her fist. Her torso is still parallel to the floor, her left leg stretched out behind her, her right one tucked beneath her body, and a long dangling pink-and-purple diamond earring trails after her. Glowing metallic blue eyes stare into the Jinni's as her mouth hangs open in furious exasperation at the need to protect her young friend. She's wearing her favorite outfit, a white dress and purple leggings. The young man's full-sized bed stands on the floor beneath her, his MacBook open on top of it. An incredible scene indeed."

The young man's room twinkled one morning.

Dust, scattered high by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was soon pierced by the hollow ring of the broom brushing metal. 

The young man knelt to grab it.

"I forgot about you," he said, twice tracing the lamp's dusty etchings with a finger. Something about the motion made him feel light and excited.

He was right to be giddy. 

Reality began to glitch. Clear red rays shot between particles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. "You've forgotten my secret," it boomed. 

Menace filled the room. Impulse pulled the young man toward bedsheets while pride kept him still. 

"I have not," he said, memory stirring. "I've rubbed you twice, I've released your might!" 

The logic seemed sound, but the Jinn was unmoved. Blue sparks began dancing around the mysterious creature. So the young man raised his fists, ready for a fight he couldn't win, but wouldn't duck.

All seemed lost. And then— 

A little fairy blurred to an unexpected stop between them.

She yelled at the Jinn, banging its nose with a tiny fist. The Jinn, at first amazed, roared with laughter. The young man stared slack jawed at the impossible sight. 

A strong purple glow suddenly lit the lamp, which lay forgotton on the floor. 

It charged the room with possibility, filling the young man with hopes and dreams of anything and everything. This was magic.

The Jinn drank it in — slaking an almost unquenchable thirst — then struck hands together. Sleep came to the young man as time shattered and crashed to the floor. He was startled awake hours later by the rumble of thunder. 

A coding school Web site glowed on the computer beside him. 

Fate, ever changing, was sealed anew.
