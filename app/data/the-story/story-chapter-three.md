One morning, the boy's room twinkled.

Dust, scattered by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was pierced by the hollow ring of the broom on metal. The boy knelt to pick it up.

"I forgot about you," he said, tracing the lamp's purple etchings with a finger.

Reality glitched. 

Clear red rays shot between sparkles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. It scowled at the dark gold lamp. 

"What are you doing," it screamed.

The Jinn leaned forward, stabbing at the boy with crisp blue sparks. "You've lost my secret," it roared. All seemed lost.

Then the tick tock of time carried a small fairy through the improbable scene. She yelled violently at the Jinn, who shrank from her sight, then turned to speak.

But the Jinn, flushed and angry, tried to slam hands around her, waking the boy with thunder. A coding school website glowed beside the darkened lamp.

Fate seemed sealed.
