His bedroom twinkled one afternoon.

Dust, scattered by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was pierced by the hollow ring of the broom on metal. The boy knelt to pick it up.

"I forgot about you," he said, tracing the lamp's purple etchings with a finger.

Reality glitched. 

Clear red rays shot between sparkles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. It scowled at the darkened gold lamp. 

"What are you doing," it screamed.

The boy groaned. "I turned over every stone," he shouted. "There's no mas!"

A storm began to brew. The Jinn leaned forward, stabbing at the boy with crisp blue sparks. "You've lost my secret," it roared. For a tick, all seemed lost.

And then the tock of time carried a small fairy through the improbable scene. She yelled violently at the Jinn, who shrank from her sight, then turned to speak.

But the Jinn, flushed and angry, tried to slam hands around her, waking the boy with thunder. A coding school website glowed beside his still dark lamp.

Fate was sealed.
