The young man's room was twinkling one morning.

Dust, scattered high by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was soon pierced by the hollow ring of the broom brushing metal. 

The young man knelt to pick up whatever sat beneath his table.

"I forgot about you," he said, twice tracing the lamp's dusty etchings with a finger. Something about the motion made him feel light and excited.

He was right to be giddy. Reality began to glitch. 

Clear red rays shot between particles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. 

"You've forgotten my secret," it boomed. Menace and warmth filled the room. 

Impulse pulled the young man toward bedsheets while pride kept him still. "I have not," he said, readying for a fight he couldn't win, but wouldn't duck. 

The Jinn looked delighted. 

Crisp blue sparks danced from its hands, as a strong purple glow lit the forgotten lamp that hung by the young man's side. The vivid colors bathed the room in life. 

A fight — driven by thrill, not friction — had brewed. All seemed lost. 

But then, a familiar figure flew between the young man and the impossible being. The small sprite yelled at the Jinn as she banged his nose in a flurry of tiny fists.

The Jinn roared with laughter and stabbed back at the fairy with dark blue sparks. The young man stared slack jawed as tension splintered to the floor and magic filled the room with the delicious taste of improbability. He beamed.

Then he woke, the sound of the Jinn clapping thunder in his ears. A coding school Web site glowed on the computer beside his gold lamp, bright purple once more.

Fate, ever changing, was sealed anew.
