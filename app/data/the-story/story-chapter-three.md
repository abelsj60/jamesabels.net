The young man's room twinkled one morning.

Dust, scattered high by a broom, was catching the sun's pale winter light. The quiet was soon pierced by the hollow ring of the broom brushing metal. 

The young man knelt to grab it.

"I forgot about you," he said, twice tracing the lamp's dusty etchings with a finger. Something about the motion made him feel light and excited.

He was right to be giddy. 

Reality began to glitch. Clear red rays shot between particles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. 

"You've forgotten my secret," it boomed. 

Menace filled the room. Impulse pulled the young man toward bedsheets while pride kept him still. 

"I have not," he said, memory stirring. "I've rubbed you twice, I've released your might!" 

The logic seemed sound, but the Jinn was unmoved. Blue sparks began dancing around the mysterious creature. So the young man raised his fists, ready for a fight he couldn't win, but wouldn't duck.

All seemed lost. And then— 

A little fairy blurred to an unexpected stop between them.

She yelled at the Jinn, banging its nose with a tiny fist. The Jinn, at first amazed, roared with laughter. The young man stared slack jawed at the impossible sight. 

A strong purple glow suddenly lit the lamp, which lay forgotton on the floor. 

It charged the room with possibility, filling the young man with hopes and dreams of anything and everything. This was magic.

The Jinn drank it in — slaking an almost unquenchable thirst — then struck hands together. Sleep came to the young man as time shattered and crashed to the floor. He was startled awake hours later by the rumble of thunder. 

A coding school Web site glowed on the computer beside him. 

Fate, ever changing, was sealed anew.
