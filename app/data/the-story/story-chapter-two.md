The boy woke at home the next morning. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. It glowed slightly purple. "What does that mean," he asked, hoping for a sign.

None came. It was just a lamp. 

So he got on with life. He studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about media, technology, and venture capital for Forbes and others.

No matter what he did, he kept the lamp nearby. The boy loved its mystery. "Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd wonder aloud sometimes. 

Best he didn't know. 

Adventure demands the unknown. Thus, there was nothing holding him back the day he met a developer and created a start-up to build two platforms. 

One made it easy to run interactive video networks online, the other to run remote software demos as smooth as Broadway.

The boy pitched them tirelessly. 

But neither took, and he tired of the tale. As he did, his golden lamp's purple glow grew dim. One morning, he stretched, knocking it dark beneath its table.
