The little sprite watched the boy from afar.

She saw many adventures. He grew, became a lawyer, then a journalist. He wrote about digital media and technology, and looked as though he again flew among the stars.

Before long, dreams carried him to his own company, and a new friend who coded the software he imagined. They built platforms unlike others — one that controlled online networks of interactive video with the specificity and sophistication of NBC, and one that let startup founders choreograph worldwide software demos as if directing a Broadway Show.

But, the fairy sighed. The boy forgot the story told about technology, not its capabilites, was what really mattered.

That was the magic.
