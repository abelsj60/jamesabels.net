The boy woke at home the next day. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. It glowed slightly purple. "What does that mean," he asked, hoping for a sign.

None came. It was just a lamp. 

So he got on with life. He studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about media, technology, and venture capital for Forbes and others.

No matter what he did, he kept the lamp nearby. The boy loved its mystery. "Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd wonder aloud sometimes. 

Best he didn't know. 

Adventure demands the unknown. Thus, there was nothing holding him back the day he met a software developer and began to build two Web platforms. 

One ran interactive video networks, the other, remote software demos, smooth like silk. He pitched them tirelessly. 

But neither took, and he tired of the tale. As he did, the golden lamp's purple glow grew dim. Then he stretched one night, knocking it beneath its table, dark.
