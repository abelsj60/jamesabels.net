The boy woke at home the next morning. 

The little lamp sat on his nightside table, glowing only slightly. "What does that mean," he asked, hoping for a sign.

None came. It was just a lamp. 

So he got on with life. He studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about media, tech, and venture capital, talking to bankers and executives for Forbes and others.

No matter what, he kept the lamp nearby. He loved its mystery. "Why do you grow brighter when I tell stories?" 

It was best he didn't know. 

Adventure demands the unknown. Thus, there was nothing holding him back the day he met a Web developer, created a start-up, and began to build software. 

One platform made it easy to control an interactive network of online video, the other to remotely run software demos that were as smooth as Broadway. 

The boy pitched them tirelessly. 

But, neither took â€” and the golden lamp grew dim. One morning, he stretched, knocking it dark beneath its table.
