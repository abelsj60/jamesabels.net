The boy woke at home the next day. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. He looked at it. 

"Why do you glow purple," he asked, hoping for a sign. There was none. 

So he got on with life. He became a lawyer, then a journalist. He covered media, technology, and venture capital as a staff reporter for Forbes and others.

But — no matter what he did — he kept the lamp nearby. 

"Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd ask aloud sometimes.

The lamp never answered. It was, after all, just a lamp. That was fine. The mystery of its glow promised adventure. And the boy loved adventure. 

So it's no surprise that he got to work the day he befriended a software developer. They were soon building their own software platforms. 

One ran interactive video networks, the other, silky smooth global software demos. The boy pitched them tirelessly and in many different ways. 

But neither took, and he slowly grew tired of the tale. 

As he did, the lamp's purple glow grew dim. 

One night, as the boy tossed and turned, he knocked the lamp to the floor. It rolled beneath its table, dark and forgotten.
