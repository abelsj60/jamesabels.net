The boy woke at home the next day. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. He looked at it. "Why do you glow purple," he asked, hoping for a sign. But there was none. 

So he got on with life. He became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He covered media, technology, and venture capital as a staff reporter Forbes and others.

No matter what he did, he kept the lamp nearby. 

"Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd ask aloud sometimes.

The lamp never answered. It was, after all, just a lamp.Â And that was fine. The mystery of its glow promised adventure. And the boy loved adventure. 

So it's no surprise that he saw nothing but wonder when he met a software developer. Fast friends, they began building two platforms for the Web. 

One ran interactive video networks, the other, silky smooth global software demos. The boy pitched them tirelessly and in many different ways. 

But neither took, and he slowly grew tired of the tale. 

As he did, the lamp's purple glow grew dim. 

One night, the boy dreamed of impossible tales. The lamp was knocked to the floor as he twisted and turned. It rolled beneath its table, dark and forgotten.
