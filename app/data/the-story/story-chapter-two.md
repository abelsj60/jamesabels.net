The boy woke at home the next morning. 

The lamp glowed beside him. The sprite was right â€” it was time to confront the world. So, the boy studied, became a lawyer and then a journalist. 

He wrote about digital media, technology, and venture capital, talking to bankers and execs for Forbes and others.

His lamp burst with bright light. Then, one day, life took a magic turn. The boy met a Web developer, started a company, and built two clever software platforms. 

One made it easy to control interactive networks of online video, the other to choreograph software demos as if directing a Broadway Show. 

The boy tirelessly pitched them, telling ever better stories about software. 

Neither took, and the boy's golden lamp grew dim. One morning, he stretched awake, knocking it dark behind his nightside table.
