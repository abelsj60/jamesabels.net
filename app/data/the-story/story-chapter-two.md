One day, the boy felt blue. 

It was time to go home. So, his little fairy friend flew him back to real life. 

The boy stetched awake in his own bed, knocking a little lamp off his nightside table. Then he grew big, and learned to navigate the wide world alone. 

The boy studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about digital media and technology, talking to bankers and executives the world wide. Life was good, then curved, and the boy found himself starting a company. 

He met a friend and built the software of his dreams. Their platforms were clever. 

One made it easy to control interactive networks of online videos. The other let people choreograph software demos with the grace of a Broadway Show. 

But neither took. 

The boy had forgotten the fairy's magic lesson. The story behind technology — not its features — mattered most.
