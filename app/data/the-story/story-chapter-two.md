title: 'True adventure'
description: "This illustration depicts chapter two. A young boy, slightly older than in chapter one, is waking one bright morning. His white t-shirt is gleaming, lit by the sunlight that streams in the window behind him. It's draped by bright yellow curtains. A bookshelf hangs off the wall, just above his brown headboard. A poster with the moon hangs on the right side of the headboard. Two fluffy white pillows lean against it, and the boy's red blanket covers his lower body. He's leaning up, resting on his left elbow, cheeks flush with excitement and a giant grin lighting up his big brown eyes. His right hand is reaching out to touch the squat gold lamp that the fairy gave him in chapter one. Bathed in purplish light, fairy dust still magically glittering around it, the gold lamp boldly fills the majority of the image's foreground. Its top and sides are ringed by mysterious runes, and the fantastic hovers all around it."

The boy woke at home the next day. 

The gold lamp sat beside him. He was thrilled as he reached for it. 

"Why do you glow purple," he asked, hoping for a sign. There was none. 

So he got on with life. He became a lawyer, then a journalist. He covered media, technology, and venture capital as a staff reporter for Forbes.com and others.

But — no matter what he did — he kept the lamp nearby. 

"Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd ask aloud sometimes.

The lamp never answered. It was, after all, just a lamp. 

That was fine. The mystery of its glow promised adventure. 

And the boy loved adventure. 

So it's no surprise that he founded a start-up the day he befriended a software developer. The two soon built their own software platforms. One personalized interactive video, the other ran silky smooth global software demos. 

The boy pitched them tirelessly and in many different ways. 

But neither took, and he slowly grew tired of the tale. 

As he did, the gold lamp's purple glow grew dim. 

One night, as the boy tossed and turned, he knocked the lamp to the floor. It rolled beneath its table, dark and forgotten.
