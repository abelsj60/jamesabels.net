The boy woke at home the next day. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. It glowed slightly purple. "What does that mean," he asked, hoping for a sign.

The lamp's purple glow seemed to brighten for a moment. But nothing else happend and the boy decided he was wrong. 

So he got on with life. He studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about media, technology, and venture capital for Forbes and others.

No matter what he did, the boy kept the lamp nearby. He loved its mystery. 

"Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd wonder aloud sometimes.

But, the lamp never answered. It was, after all, just a lamp. And, anyway, it's best not to know. 

Adventure demands the unknown. 

So, there was nothing holding the boy back when he met a software developer. Fast friends, the two soon began building two software platforms for the Web. 

One ran interactive video networks, the other, remote software demos, smooth as silk. The boy pitched them tirelessly in many different ways. 

But neither took, and he wearied of the tale. 

As he did, the lamp's purple glow grew dim. One night, while stretching, the boy knocked the lamp beneath its table, dark.
