The boy woke at home the next day. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. It glowed slightly purple. "Why do you glow," he asked, hoping for a sign.

The lamp seemed to brighten for a moment. But nothing else happend. 

So the boy got on with life. He studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about media, technology, and venture capital for Forbes and others.

No matter what he did, he kept the lamp nearby. He loved its mystery. 

"Why do you get brighter when I tell stories," he'd ask aloud sometimes.

The lamp never answered. It was, after all, just a lamp. And, anyway, sometimes it's best not to know. 

Adventure demands the unknown. 

So it's no surprise that the boy saw nothing but wonder when he met a software developer. Fast friends, they began building two software platforms for the Web. 

One ran interactive video networks, the other, silky smooth remote software demos. The boy pitched them tirelessly in many different ways. 

But neither took, and he grew tired of the tale. 

As he did, the lamp's purple glow grew dim. One night, the boy stretched and knocked the lamp beneath its table, dark.
