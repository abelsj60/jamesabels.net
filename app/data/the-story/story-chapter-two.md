The boy woke at home the next morning. 

The gold lamp sat on his bedside table. It glowed slightly purple. "What does that mean," he asked, hoping for a sign.

None came. It was just a lamp. 

So he got on with life. He studied, became a lawyer, and then a journalist. He wrote about media, technology, and venture capital for Forbes and others.

No matter what he did, he kept the lamp nearby. The boy loved its mystery. "Why do you get brighter when I tell stories?" 

Best he didn't know. 

Adventure demands the unknown. Thus, there was nothing holding him back the day he met a Web developer, created a start-up, and began to build software. 

One program made it easy to control an interactive network of online video, the other to remotely run software demos that were as smooth as Broadway. 

The boy pitched them tirelessly. 

But neither took, and he tired of the tale. As he did, his golden lamp's purple glow grew dim. One morning, he stretched, knocking it dark beneath its table.
