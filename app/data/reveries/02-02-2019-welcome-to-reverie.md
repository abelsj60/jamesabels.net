Hi. Welcome to Reverie.

I'm not entirely sure what this is, but here's what it's not:

* A place for regular commentary
* Something terribly serious
* A click-bait machine

Here's what it may be:

A spot for a few thoughts about whatever inspires me, momentarily. That should keep it light, although, I have a couple longer pieces I'd like to do about things like:  

* The state of broadcast TV Web sites
* Some thoughts on Netflix and Amazon Prime
* A question about privacy options on smartphones

Here's how it works:

* Reverie is accessed through the footer, not header, because it's irregular and ancillary to the rest of the site. Like a daydream.
* Clicking Reverie from Reverie will take you back to whereever you came from in the site. If you came direct, you'll go home.
* I built this from scratch. It's an actual, real-life, home-grown blog. Half the point was to figure out how to do it. I'll write about that soon-ish.

What about social sharing and the like?

Well, let's see if I keep this up and if anyone reads, then I can explore. 

What about Medium, where all the cool kids write these days?

Meh. Something to be said for going old school, for now.

That's it. Look around. Email me. Enjoy.
