slug: Netflix wouldn't let me take its survey
---

Netflix rejected me today.

The company had just sent me a survey request. I'd get a free month for every survey I take. I qualified for three daily surveys and would get a bonus month if I did them all. COOL!

Let's do it.

Netflix asked me my name, rank, and serial number.

Then it asked what I do. I clicked software development.

The survey ended on the next screen. 

Where's the collegiality, the intellectual curiosity, the trust? 

Say it ain't so, Netflix! Say it ain't so!
