Sad to say, I have a pedestal sink. 

It's got a wide, flat bottom. I'm sure I used to think these things looked great. Then I got one. It's got three problems:

1. Spit after brushing your teeth? Don't lean too low, it'll bounce back at you because the sink's flat.

2. The sink gets dirty very quickly because flat bottoms don't drain well.

3. There's nowhere to put anything because the pedestal's bezel is thin-n-narrow. 
   
I know these things look good on Instagram, but they're lousy roommates.
