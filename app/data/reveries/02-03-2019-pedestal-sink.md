Sad to say, I have a pedestal sink. 

It's got a wide, flat bottom. I'm sure I thought these things looked great in pictures once. Then I got one. Three problems:

1. Don't lean to low if you spit after brushing your teeth. It often bounces back at you because the bottom's flat.

2. The sink gets dirty very quickly because flat bottoms don't drain well.

3. There's almost nowhere to put anything because the pedestal's bezel is thin-n-narrow. 
   
I know these things look good on Instagram, but they make for lousy roommates.
