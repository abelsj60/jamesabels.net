Dear Netflix,

I know you lead the industry when it comes to software development.

Unfortunately, I haveÂ several problems with your platform. This one involves your autoplaying trailers. You can reproduce the problem via the following steps: 

1. Load the Netflix site.
2. Start a show or movie. 
3. Cast it to a television via a Google Chromecast. 
4. (It does not matter if you use Chrome's internal menu or the Chromecast icon that appears in your video player.)
5. Sit down to enjoy the show.
6. Cringe when it's interrupted by the sound of a trailer.
7. Look around wildly to find the computer where Netflix.com is loaded. 
8. Groan. 
9. Ask the Gods why Netflix's developers don't disable these trailers when a video is being Cast.
10. Futz with the Netflix site to silence the trailers, probably by slamming the spacebar twice to skip both of them.

The whole thing is very annoying. 

I've begun to wonder if I should switch to Disney+ or CBS All Access. Well, no, not really...but "Star Trek: Picard." Can't say no to that...

All the best.
