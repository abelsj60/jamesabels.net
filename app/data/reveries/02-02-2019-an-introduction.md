Sad to say, I have a pedestal sink. 

It's got a wide, flat bottom. I'm sure I used to think these things looked great. Then I got one. It's got three problems:

1. Spit after brushing your teeth? It'll bounce back at you because it's flat.

2. It gets dirty instantly because flat bottoms don't drain.

3. There's nowhere to put anything because the pedestal is thin-n-narrow. 
   
I know these things look great on Instagram, but owning one's miserable.
