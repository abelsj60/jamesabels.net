slug: Make Alexa to turn herself off

I taught Alexa to turn herself off last night. 

The idea comes courtesy of my friend John Loconsolo.

I have an Echo Show 2. I got it as a freebie from Amazon because I published a second Alexa skill just after the Show 2 launched. 

Like a lot of people, I think Alexa's cool, but I don't like wondering if she's listening even when she's not supposed to be. So here's what I did: I set up a smartplug and named it "yourself." Then I connected the Show to it. Then I connected the smart plug to Alexa. It took about ten minutes. 

Now I can say "Alexa, turn yourself off." And she does! I have an app on my phone to turn her on when I want her. It's very amusing. Thanks, John!
