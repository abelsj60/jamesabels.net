Grab a chair, sit on down, and I'll tell you a tale of the impossible.

We begin with the end. This website got me a job on March 13, 2020, the same day Donald Trump, then U.S. president, declared a Federal State of Emergency over Covid-19.

I was a lawyer-turned-journalist-turned-shipwrecked-start-up-captain.

And I was looking to turn coder. Why not? I'd done everything but skydive while eating spiders. 

This seemed safer.

My thesis was simple. A creative-turned-coder brings something new to the table. This site would prove it. Responsible people found the idea baffling. But, if you've looked around, you already know I believe in heart, magic, and impossible things. 

Stranger things had already happened.

A former source, Upendra Shardanand, had emailed with a question a few months earlier, shortly after I graduated from Fullstack Academy, a 12-week coding bootcamp. 

Did I want to work with him on Colleague Zero, his side project. It used Facebook Messenger to explore how dialogue agents could support new types of media content and business models. 

The part-time gig paid me to code, learn, and help invent something new. 

It was stellar — an apprenticeship that meant the world to me.

But I would need a full-time position at some point. 

I thought I'd get one by building this website. 

One day, I was on the phone with Jared Klee, the founder of Triple Point Liquidity, a fintech startup. 

We were talking about whether I had enough experience to work on his startup's webapp. I solved the problem by asking a question about this website. "Who else would build something like this," I asked. 

"Exx-xactly," he said.

I've been at Triple Point ever since. 

Lately, I've been thinking about a new personal project. I have some ideas about AI and media. I plan to start writing about them soon. But, before I do, I wanted to finish the thread that ties these first Reveries together — starting over. 

I dedicate this site to anyone who breaks the rules — even if all the people, all the experienced people, call you crazy. There are no limits out there. 

Just pick your path — and believe.
