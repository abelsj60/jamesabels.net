slug: Make Alexa to turn herself off

I taught Alexa to turn herself off last night. 

The idea comes courtesy of my friend John Loconsolo.

I have an Echo Show 2. I got it as a freebie from Amazon because I published a second Alexa skill just after the Show 2 launched. 

Like a lot of people, I think Alexa's cool, but I don't like wondering if she's listening even when she's not supposed to be. So here's what I did. I got a smart plug and named it "yourself." Then I plugged the Echo Show into it. Then I paired it with Alexa. It took about ten minutes. 

Now I can say "Alexa, turn yourself off." And she does! Thanks, John!
