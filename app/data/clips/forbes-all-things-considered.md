National Public Radio has seen its share of shake-ups lately, including
the departure of chief executive Ken Stern in March. Soon after, an NPR
journalist reported the reason was a failure "to convince the board where
local stations fit into the digital age, when listeners can bypass
old-fashioned FM stations." Like all media, NPR — which supplies
programming to over 860 local radio stations — is struggling with the
results of the Internet's ability to cheaply distribute content.

Late last month, Kinsey Wilson joined NPR as senior vice president and
general manager of NPR Digital Media from Gannet- owned USA Today, where
he was executive editor. One early goal: to boost NPR's traffic, which
comScore estimates at some 2.2 million unique visitors in September.
Forbes.com talked with him about the future of public radio and the role
of its 38-year old affiliate network. Here's an edited version of what he
had to say:

Forbes.com: What attracted you to the NPR job after running Internet
operations at USA Today?

Kinsey Wilson: I think NPR is at a point where it's really poised to take
advantage of digital. I don't think, in the long term, we can think of
ourselves as a radio or purely as an audio news organization.

Do you have any examples of how that's coming along?

We're in the process of integrating our editorial digital staff and the
rest of the editorial staff. Dick Meyer, who heads the Digital Editorial
Staff, reports to me and to Ellen Weiss, who is the VP for news.

Increasing the unique visitors to NPR content is a priority online, how
do you accomplish that?

We've moved from being primarily destination sites to moving into an arena
where it is all about distributed media. We've got an architecture that
supports open distribution of our content. So you try to create a virtual
circle between high-quality content, ease of distribution and a connection
with audiences that inspires them to distribute links, etc. ... I think
that's where the real opportunity for traffic growth is.

So you are trying to work with the local affiliates digitally and not
supplant them?

Deepening and improving our relationships with our member stations is a
big priority. It's difficult to say exactly how technology will change the
ways in which the content is distributed and the relationship between the
member stations and NPR in Washington.

If you're looking at consumer preference, the answer may not be the
local affiliate's site. What then?

In this environment you cannot ultimately fight the tide of consumer
preference. I think the good news is that that's the subject of open,
transparent, healthy conversation within the organization at this point.

But you think there's time to figure it out?

The speed in which our business is being challenged is very different than
that of most of our commercial brethren. It does so far have the advantage
of not being forced to react to things in quite the same kind of time
frame. [One reason is] our audience is growing. There is a tremendous
opportunity for the local stations, particularly with newspapers suffering
the kind of staff cuts and reductions that they have, to become an even
more robust provider of news to their communities.

Does NPR offer something particularly valuable to digital news
consumers?

[People] want analysis. I think they also want a connection with
individuals; they want to understand something about the person that
stands behind the news report. I think the mix of authority and
familiarity that NPR has managed to combine on air is something that
translates very nicely to the Web, where the traditional, formal voice of
authority of a newspaper or even a traditional network television
broadcast does not meet the expectations of Web readers.
