  "TMMnews was a dedicated home for video stories about media-tech. The site featured original videos, reporter's notes, and aggregated headlines from Daylife, a New York-based start-up.",
  'Original news stories were anchored by James Erik Abels, a former media reporter from Forbes and Mergermarket. Over 100 stories were produced, ranging from exclusives to news analyses.',
  "In 2011, TMM was asked to contribute to New York City's FIRST Robotics Competition. A team of ten media professionals volunteered to run a three-hour live Internet broadcast of the event."
