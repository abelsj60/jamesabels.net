pitch: 
  'Personalize interactive video at scale'
type:
  'Founder'
technologies: 
  'Cloud: AWS ∙ Language: PHP ∙ Transcoding: FFmpeg'
responsibility: 
  'As the founder of Three Minute Media, I oversaw corporate affairs and platform development, including our lead developer, budget, and investor outreach.'
story: 
  "Over 200 million people watch Internet video in the US every year. Arrow, our self-serve platform, made it easy for any publisher to personalize their video at scale."

  'This is the Editor. It was used to prepare video for publication by adding them to a Stack, then selecting personalization criteria via dynamically generated settings. It syndicated video, too.',
  'This is the Developer Module. It allowed Arrow to be extended for use with custom media formats, settings, and live control. Arrow could publish any code-based media package.',
  'This is the Encapsulated Presentation Module ("EPM"). Developers used it to extend Arrow by mixing their source code with PubML, our proprietary domain-specific programming language.',
  'These are Stack Settings. They were used by editors to add personalization criteria to their videos. These settings were dynamically generated from code found within each active EPM.',
  'These are Live Controls. They were used by editors to modify media in real time, after publication. Like Settings, they were dynamically generated from code found within each active EPM.'

description: [
  "This is a screenshot of Arrow's Editor module. A large video preview sits at the top of the page, just beneath a header. A light grey line separates the preview from a set of asset libraries to the bottom left. A 'Stack Rack' sits to the bottom right. The Stack Rack consists of a blue-grey box with black and blue text, a set of large blue control buttons at the top — including items such as a plus sign, subtraction sign, and sideways triangle for play — and a video thumbnail in the active Stack list at the top of the Rack. The page background is white and icons representing Arrow's various modules are in a light blue Dock on the left edge of the screen.",
  "This is a screenshot of Arrow's Developer Module. Three buttons sit at the top beneath the header and module title. These buttons toggle the users's ability to create and edit Encapsulated Presentation Modules (EPMs) and macros. Beneath these buttons is a large white text box containing an EPM — JavaScript mixed with PubML, our proprietary domain-specific programming language. Beneath this box sit two buttons named 'cancel' and 'update.' The page background is white and icons representing Arrow's various modules are in a light blue Dock on the left edge of the screen.",
  "This is a screenshot of one of the Encapsulated Programming Modules (EPM) that control Arrow. An EPM is a mixture of JavaScript and PubML, our proprietary domain-specific programming language. The EPM tells Arrow how to assemble and deliver interactive video/media packages. To the left of the image are brackets explaining its major sections and features. These include descriptions about how to add metadata, build visual controls for users, and mix proprietary code with PubML. This version of the EPM is syntax-highlighted in order to easily distinguish between PubML and JavaScript.",
  "This is a screenshot of the Stack Settings modal window. It sits above the Editor module, which is darkened by a translucent black overlay. A Stack is the container (usually for videos) that Arrow controls on various Web pages. It is usually contains videos. The Stack Settings modal is used to select which EPM to add to a Stack. To the left of the window are two text boxes. One names the Stack, the other keeps notes about it. To the right is a drop-down menu. It's used to select an EPM. A set of buttons sit just beneath it. They bring different sets of functionality to screen, such as configuration settings or live controls. Configuration settings is active in this image. They're dynamically generated from instructions inside the selected EPM and are used to configure how each EPM will work. The settings can include checkboxes, drop-down lists, and text boxes.",

The controls can include buttons, drop-down lists, and sliders."
