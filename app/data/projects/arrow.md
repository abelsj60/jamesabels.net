    "As the founder of Three Minute Media, I oversaw corporate affairs and platform development, including budgets, our product lead, and investor outreach.",
  story: 
    'Arrow was a self-serve platform that made it easy for editorial and sales teams to personalize and syndicate interactive video based on first- and third-party data.',
  captions: [
    "The Editor was used to build video programming by adding videos to a Stack and configuring it with dynamically generated settings. Users could buy and sell their videos through syndication.",
    "The Developer Module was used to extend Arrow with custom media formats, settings, and live controls. Arrow delivered any code-based media, including video players, widgets, and more.",
    "The Encapsulated Presentation Module allowed Arrow's extensibility. It was a mixture of PubML, our proprietary domain-specific programming language, and a user's proprietary source code.",
    "Stack Settings configured video and other programming. They were dynamically generated from instructions in an Encapsulated Presentation Module. Users could create or license their EPMs.",
    "Live controls modified media after deployment. Like Settings, they were dynamically generated from an Encapsulated Presentation Module, making Arrow a true end-to-end publishing system."
