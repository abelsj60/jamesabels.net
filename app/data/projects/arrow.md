  'This is the Editor. It was used to prepare video for publication by adding them to a Stack, then selecting personalization criteria via dynamically generated settings. It syndicated video, too.',
  'This is the Developer Module. It allowed Arrow to be extended for use with custom media formats, settings, and live control. Arrow could publish any code-based media package.',
  'This is the Encapsulated Presentation Module ("EPM"). Developers used it to extend Arrow by mixing their source code with PubML, our proprietary domain-specific programming language.',
  'These are Stack Settings. They were used by editors to add personalization criteria to their videos. These settings were dynamically generated from code found within each active EPM.',
  'These are Live Controls. They were used by editors to modify media in real time, after publication. Like Settings, they were dynamically generated from code found within each active EPM.'
