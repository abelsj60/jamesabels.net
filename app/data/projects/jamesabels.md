  "This image shows a screenshot of the front page of this site. It features a young man and fairy looking into a set of monitors that show a magical forrest. The forrest is blue and purple, has floating crystals and balls of light. An old stone portal sits in the center of the image. Runes ring its edges. At its center, which glows yellow-green, sits my name and a brief bio.",
  "This image shows a screenshot of a page that features one of my articles from Forbes.com. The page has a pink header, white header text, black text content, and light blue footer text.",
  "This image shows a screenshot of a story page. It has a pink header, translucent blue body, which consists of a a blurred out image and midnight-blue tint. The story text that sits on top of the body stands out in sharp white. The book and chapter title that sits about the story text is bright yellow. White footer text and a button that turns the story text on and off to reveal the illustration beneath it, complete the page. ",
  "This image shows a screenshot of a the business card that's found on every page of the site. It's turned on and off by clicking the word 'contact' in the Footer. The business card sits center stage, sandwiched between the header and footer, on a frosty blue background. The site beneath it is blurred out of focus. The card features an illustration of a teen boy, hand on hip, and a fairy floating above his left shoulder. My name and email is located on the card to the right of the image. The motto reads 'Let's code your story'."
