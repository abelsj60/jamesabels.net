  "This is the Remote. It provided push-button control over our interactive software stage, enabling presenters to swiftly deliver media, such as YouTube, props, and more, to audiences in real time.",
  "The remote delivered slides, too. Thus, presenters could add drama to a presentation by reviewing a slide, switching to live media on their software stage, then seamlessly returning to the talk.",
  "The presenter has delivered a YouTube video and its embed code to the stage.",
  "The presenter has called attention to the YouTube video's embed code with a prop.",
  "The presenter is discussing a slide before showing a live YouTube video and its embed code."

description: [
  "This is a screenshot of Slingshot's Remote. It's used to control presentations on Guest computers and devices. The app is broken into three main sections. A header stretches the length of the page at the top of the screen. Right below it sits a large 'monitor.' Beginning at the left edged, it takes up two thirds of the screen. The rest is taken up by a control pattern to its right. The control panel is full of buttons. As to details: The header area offers system-wide controls. On its left are a check box and an icon representing a person. This icon sits beside a number, which tells presenters how large the current audience is. The check box tells them when all the guest machines have received and executed the last command. Two buttons sit to the right of the icon and number. They toggle the Remote between showing the monitor and a ticket window. The monitor represents the current state of Guest machines, while the ticket window generates admission tokens for guests. To the right of these header buttons sits a single control named 're-sync.' It rebuilds the state of guest machines when an error occurs, such as a lost connection. To its right sit four buttons. Presenters use them to toggle between four control panels. They choreograph what's happening on Guest machines, such as what media's on stage, how it's configured, real-time interaction with it, and slide control. These control panels are have a slate-blue background. The current view is of Stage controls, which consist of drop-down lists — they target desktop and mobile devices — and a set of buttons. They select and show live media on a Guest's machine, as well as to refresh the screen, add highlights to it, and more. To the right of the panel sits the monitor. It shows what guests are seeing. It currently shows the cover of a pitch deck.",

  "This is a screenshot of a Guest machine during a presentation controlled by Slingshot. The only thing on the page is a large slide center stage. It has been selected by the presenter, and is shown via a standard HTML image element, as opposed to the video feed that most presentation software uses.",
  "This is a screenshot of a Guest machine during a presentation controlled by Slingshot. It shows the Stage. A YouTube video sits center stage, its embed code just below it. The video has been selected by the presenter via the Remote, and is shown on Guest machines via the embed code that's displayed beneath it, as opposed to being shown via the video feed that most presentation software uses.",

The video has been selected by the presenter via the Remote, and is shown on Guest machines via the embed code that's displayed beneath it, as opposed to being shown via the video feed that most presentation software uses. Most of the screen, including the YouTube video, is darkened by a translucent grey overlay. However, the embed code beneath the video sits on a bright white background. It's also surrounded by a 'spotlight', a thick yellow border that allows the presenter to draw Guest attention to a particular regions of the Stage in order to make a point about it."
