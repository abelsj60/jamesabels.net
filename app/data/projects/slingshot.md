  "This is the Remote. It offered hands-free control over slides and software. Presenters could use it to run global software demos or to wander the room during in-person meetings.",
  "The Remote controlled interactivity. A presenter could use it to refresh a viewer's screen, to start and stop a live video, and more. In this case, it was used to add a live YouTube video to screen.",
  "Once logged in, viewers saw a plain white Web page. Presenters then used the Remote to decide what appeared on it. In this case, a slide is being shown.",
  "Once logged in, viewers saw a plain white Web page. Presenters then used the Remote to decide what appeared on it. In this case, a live YouTube video and its embed code are being shown.",
