captions: [
  "Presenters used the Remote on a dedicated device to control what guests saw on a separate screen during software demos. In this view, the Remote is being used to control a slide deck.",
  "After logging in, users were greeted by a plain white Web page. The presenter then used the Remote to add HTML elements to screen in real time. In this case, a slide image was added.",
  "Presenters were not limited to slides. The Remote could also be used to control a variety of live 'props', such as YouTube videos, spotlights, and any other element that punctuated a point.",
  "The Remote let presenters show guests live HTML 'props', such as YouTube videos, playing cards, and more. In this view, a YouTube video and embed code are shown. Each is a separate element.",
  "Slingshot's ultimate goal was to help presenters make key points during software demos. In this view, an embed code is being spotlighted in yellow to make a  point about video delivery."
