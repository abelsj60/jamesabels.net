  type: 'Perfect software demos worldwide',
  technologies: 'Cloud: AWS ∙ Language: PHP ∙ Broadcasting: PubNub / Websockets',
  contribution:
    "As Three Minute Media's founder, I oversaw platform development, managing our project lead and prioritizing features.",
  description:
    'Unlike most presentation platforms, which prioritize slide/graphic design, SlingShot focuses on the choreography of live software demonstrations. It makes it easy for a presenter to give a non-linear presentation, switching between slides and live product features in order to tell the best story possible.',
