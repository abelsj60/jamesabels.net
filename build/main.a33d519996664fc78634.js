The fairy dove in, disappearing for what felt like eons. The boy\'s eyes were heavy when she flew out, clutching the very thing they\'d sought — a golden lamp, etched by purple incantations. \n\n"The adventure matters most," she said as she read one aloud. \n\n"In bright day and black night, through tall tale and purple light, rub me twice and release my might, if..."

Something about the motion made him feel light and excited.\n\nHe was right to be giddy. Reality began to glitch. \n\nClear red rays shot between particles of dust, drawing a giant Jinn into view. \n\n\"You've forgotten my secret,\" it boomed. Menace and warmth filled the room. \n\nImpulse pulled the young man toward bedsheets while pride kept him still. \"I have not,\" he said, readying for a fight he couldn't win, but wouldn't duck. \n\nThe Jinn looked delighted. \n\nCrisp blue sparks danced from its hands, as a strong purple glow lit the forgotten lamp that hung by the young man's side. The vivid colors bathed the room in life. \n\nA fight — driven by thrill, not friction — had brewed. All seemed lost. \n\nBut then, a familiar figure flew between the young man and the impossible being. The small sprite yelled at the Jinn as she banged his nose in a flurry of tiny fists.\n\nThe Jinn roared with laughter and stabbed back at the fairy with dark blue sparks. The young man stared slack jawed as tension splintered to the floor and magic filled the room with the delicious taste of improbability.

He wrote about media, technology, and venture capital for Forbes and others.\n\nNo matter what he did, the boy kept the lamp nearby. He loved its mystery. \n\n\"Why do you get brighter when I tell stories,\" he'd wonder aloud sometimes.\n\nBut, the lamp never answered. It was, after all, just a lamp. And, anyway, it's best not to know. \n\nAdventure demands the unknown. \n\nSo, there was nothing holding the boy back when he met a software developer. Fast friends, the two soon began building two software platforms for the Web. \n\nOne ran interactive video networks, the other, remote software demos, smooth as silk.

But Intel brought the next major round\ncloser to a head last week when it said it would buy start-up Mashery for\na reported \\$180 million. The seven-year-old business helps people manage\ntheir application programming interfaces, or APIs.\n\nAn API is like the connector on a Lego block. Developers use it to connect\nsites and apps to a variety of technologies. Thus, they don’t have to\ncreate these technologies on their own.\n\nIntel’s move is simultaneously important and ironic. It was once a part of\nthe same start-up scene it is now trying to penetrate by buying Mashery.\nSo, on one hand, Intel wants to be at the center of an Internet-focused\ndeveloper ecosystem. But, on the other, the need to buy into it shows huge\ntech firms like Intel need help relating to a lot of these start-up\ntechnologists.\n\nAs an example, take its new foray into media. Intel is developing a\nsubscription-based online TV service. It wants to compete with cable\ncarriers by selling a high-end package of highly interactive video\nprogramming delivered via its own set-top box.\n\nForget the merits of the strategy. What’s interesting is that the start-up\necosystem is loaded with companies pursuing similar businesses. These\nrange from helping producers sell video to audiences directly, to using\nsocial media to aggregate video into personal channels.\n\nIn other words, Intel wants to use Mashery to help these smaller players\nshape markets, and it also wants to compete with them by dominating the\nsame markets they are trying to shape.\n\nClearly, the relationship between huge tech and newer Internet-based\ndevelopers is complicated.\n\nMost of these developers want to build software quickly using self-serve,\nplug-and-play technologies, such as APIs. By contrast, huge tech often\nworks more slowly, jumps into big markets directly, and prefers software\nthat relies on high-cost components and services.\n\nThe problem is that the start-up approach is less profitable, which is\nunsettling for huge tech.\n\nTake Oracle. When it bought Sun Microsystems in 2009, the famed MySQL\ndatabase came with it. MySQL is free-to-use, so is relied on by a lot of\nInternet-era developers. But, in 2011, Oracle added some extensions to it\nthat aren’t as free-to-use as many of these developers would like.\n\nThat decision helped encourage a group of them to create a new,\nindependent version named MariaDB. Now, talk is bubbling up online about\nswitching between the two databases.\n\nThe example shows how hard it can be for huge tech to work with developers\nwho were formed in the Internet age. In other words, can Intel buy Mashery\nand satisfy this part of the start-up’s clientele, or will it set policies\nthat push them toward rivals like Apigee, MuleSoft, or 3scale?\n\nMicrosoft, the poster child of huge tech, is the canary in this coal mine.\nIt followed Amazon online to offer a “cloud” services platform roughly\nthree years ago. Its Windows Azure is reportedly pretty good, but hasn’t\nstoked the same fire online as Amazon’s Web Services division.\n\nThat’s one reason Microsoft recently said it will match some of Amazon’s\nWeb Services pricing. It’s also been adding features to woo more\nInternet-oriented developers.\n\nMoves like these could establish whether huge tech can co-exist with\nnew-era software firms – or if these start-ups will shrink the technology\nbusiness as much as they’ve shrunk everyone else’s.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'A huge Tech vs. Start-up Battle Simmers'\npublication: 'Blouin News'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},368:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Can Apple Be Out-Appled?",publication:"Blouin News",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nCan Apple wow the world a third time? It certainly seems to think so.\n\nTim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, gave a long interview to the Wall\nStreet Journal this month. The top executive used the conversation to\naddress persistent concerns among investors that Apple is fresh out of\ninnovative new ideas. He assured it that Apple is working on new product\ncategories.\n\nIn other words, it’s working on products that are different from the\ncomputers, smartphones and tablets, it sells today. But, that doesn’t mean\nApple is working on products that no one has ever seen before. That’s what\npeople expect from it these days. After all, its most recent successes\nstemmed from its uncanny ability to release products that no one’s ever\nseen before.\n\nFor instance, Google built a phone prior to the iPhone’s arrival. But, it\nwasn’t anything like the all-glass, futuristic smartphone Apple imagined.\nAs a result, Google reportedly scrapped its project to start again. The\niPad offers a similar story. Microsoft called tablets the future of\ncomputing for years. And yet, people ignored the message.\n\nWhy? They didn’t really like Microsoft’s Windows-centric vision of tablet\ncomputing. But, they liked Apple’s. So, as far as anyone is concerned, it\ninvented both markets from whole cloth.\n\nBut, things have changed. The world watched Apple’s incredible magic trick\ntwice now. So, a lot of equally wealthy and intelligent companies have\ninvested a lot of money in following suit. This is especially clear in\n\nthe arena of “wearable computers.”\n\nIn 2012, a lot of people decided these devices were the best way to\nout-Apple Apple.\n\nThe idea was arguably jump-started by a small startup named inPusle (now\nPebble). The company shattered records in mid-2012 when people gave it\nover \\$10 million on Kickstarter to help it build its Pebble smartwatch.\nThe Pebble moment made it famous, and suggested a huge untapped market for\nwearable computers.\n\nGoogle reinforced the point by showing off a Google Glass prototype around\nthe same time. Glass is a monocle that people wear over one eye to project\na digital landscape on the world around them.\n\nThen, the floodgates seemed to open.\n\nNike released the Fuelband in 2012, helping to kick off a genre of\nhigh-tech bracelets that track telemetry about the human body. A year\nlater, Samsung released its Galaxy Gear smartwatch. And, companies like\nGoPro released a new generation of small wearable video cameras to help\npeople record themselves 24/7. They must be somewhat popular. GoPro is now\ngoing public.\n\nNot enough? Oculus VR also blew people’s minds in 2012 when it\nsuccessfully Kickstarted its new take on virtual reality goggles. Like the\nPebble, the Oculus Rift inspired the imagination. Since then, several\ncompetitors have appeared with their own take on Oculus’s inspired idea.\n\nThe point here is that new product categories have exploded.\n\nNew ones could still come along, but that’s probably less likely than\never. Let’s consider this in the context of some of biggest and brightest\nrumors about Apple’s new technologies. The next version of iOS is said to\nbe focused on tracking health stats about its users. This would put it in\ndirect competition with a limitless universe of Apple-compatible health\ngadgets.\n\nSimilarly, Apple is said to be working on some sort computer-based TV or\nset-top box. This market is already flooded with entrants. And, a new\nrumor surfaced just this month that Apple has 200 people working on a new\nsmartwatch.\n\nApple has a better shot than anyone at getting these products just right.\nBut, for the first time in years, its new technologies could also just get\nlost in a sea of gadgets — like tears in rain.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Can Apple Be Out-Appled?'\npublication: 'Blouin News'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},369:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Commodity Beckons New TV Services from Comcast, Microsoft, and More",publication:"Blouin News",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nGracenote offered an important lesson about internet technology last week.\n\nThe company, best known for technology that identifies music, released a\ntool that helps developers build apps that know what is playing on nearby\ntelevision sets. The tool, named eyeQ, uses a mobile device’s built-in\nmicrophone to compare a show’s audio with an online database about TV.\nThis means the device can be turned into a second screen featuring\ninteractive content about the show.\n\nTelevision networks thought this kind of “audio fingerprinting” would help\nthem stave off new online media rivals just a few years ago. For instance,\nThe Nielsen Company, which tracks TV ratings, introduced a similar\ntechnology in 2010 for its partners named Media-Sync. The ABC TV network\ngot an Emmy nomination by using it with some shows, including “Grey’s\nAnatomy.”\n\nNow, thanks to Gracenote, anyone can do the same thing.\n\nThe new reality is a powerful reminder that media isn’t the only thing\nturning into a commodity online. Technology is too. The lesson comes at an\nimportant moment for big TV firms and huge tech companies. Both groups are\nreadying a new generation of TV services that will add internet-style\ninteractivity to traditional video programming.\n\nThe biggest splash is coming from Microsoft right now. It unveiled the\nXbox One last month. The next generation game-turned-entertainment box is\nbilled as an entertainment extravaganza. The top of Microsoft’s newly\nformed entertainment studios says the device will merge high-end\nstory-telling with incredible interactivity.\n\nBig media execs are excited. Steven Spielberg is developing a TV show for\nthe Xbox One that’s set in the Halo video-game universe. And both the NFL\nand ESPN sports network are planning content for the box too.\n\nMicrosoft isn’t the only one betting on a new closed, but highly\ninteractive TV service.\n\nIntel is developing its own set-top box and service with similar\naspirations. Comcast is preparing new internet-based technology to more\neasily combine its video with interactive features. And Time Warner Cable\nplans to send video directly to internet TVs from Samsung through an app\nthat will make its video very interactive.\n\nThese companies all hope their sophisticated new services will beat back a\nsea of internet rivals.\n\nGlenn Britt, the chief executive of Time Warner Cable, puts it like this:\n“I think all this over-the-top stuff [internet media] is largely about\nfunctionality that’s enabled by technology that people haven’t been able\nto get with our traditional technology.”\n\nThat is true. The problem is that the “traditional technology” operated in\na vacuum. Only a few companies could afford to build and run broadcast,\ncable, or satellite transmission systems.\n\nNow, the internet lets anyone build their online equivalent. In other\nwords, Britt and company are creating technology that won’t stay unique\nfor long. It’s only a matter of time before someone offers a cheaper,\neasier, more advanced internet version that anyone can use.\n\nThis “Gracenote problem” is just a fact-of-life today.\n\nMedia-tech executives are sure to say they still have the advantage. After\nall, they have the professional TV shows that people love. They’d be right\nif their lock on this type of content hadn’t just officially slipped.\n\nThis month, DreamWorks Animation – a major Hollywood studio – said it\nwould produce 300 hours of serialized TV programming for Netflix. The\nstudio has struggled to find hits of late, so wants to exploit the biggest\nunexploited opportunity it can find. Apparently, that’s internet-only\nvideo. The big studio’s embrace of Netflix is huge.\n\nIt means broadcast and cable companies are no longer seen as the masters\nof the market’s best video. Thus, their new systems – and huge tech’s too\n– are destined to compete with smaller online rivals that pair equally\ngreat technology with equally great video.\n\nDon’t worry, though. Gracenote will still know what you’re watching.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Commodity Beckons New TV Services from Comcast, Microsoft, and More'\npublication: 'Blouin News'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},370:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"All Things Considered Digitally",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:"\nNational Public Radio has seen its share of shake-ups lately, including\nthe departure of chief executive Ken Stern in March. Soon after, an NPR\njournalist reported the reason was a failure \"to convince the board where\nlocal stations fit into the digital age, when listeners can bypass\nold-fashioned FM stations.\" Like all media, NPR — which supplies\nprogramming to over 860 local radio stations — is struggling with the\nresults of the Internet's ability to cheaply distribute content.\n\nLate last month, Kinsey Wilson joined NPR as senior vice president and\ngeneral manager of NPR Digital Media from Gannet- owned USA Today, where\nhe was executive editor. One early goal: to boost NPR's traffic, which\ncomScore estimates at some 2.2 million unique visitors in September.\nForbes.com talked with him about the future of public radio and the role\nof its 38-year old affiliate network. Here's an edited version of what he\nhad to say:\n\nForbes.com: What attracted you to the NPR job after running Internet\noperations at USA Today?\n\nKinsey Wilson: I think NPR is at a point where it's really poised to take\nadvantage of digital. I don't think, in the long term, we can think of\nourselves as a radio or purely as an audio news organization.\n\nDo you have any examples of how that's coming along?\n\nWe're in the process of integrating our editorial digital staff and the\nrest of the editorial staff. Dick Meyer, who heads the Digital Editorial\nStaff, reports to me and to Ellen Weiss, who is the VP for news.\n\nIncreasing the unique visitors to NPR content is a priority online, how\ndo you accomplish that?\n\nWe've moved from being primarily destination sites to moving into an arena\nwhere it is all about distributed media. We've got an architecture that\nsupports open distribution of our content. So you try to create a virtual\ncircle between high-quality content, ease of distribution and a connection\nwith audiences that inspires them to distribute links, etc. ... I think\nthat's where the real opportunity for traffic growth is.\n\nSo you are trying to work with the local affiliates digitally and not\nsupplant them?\n\nDeepening and improving our relationships with our member stations is a\nbig priority. It's difficult to say exactly how technology will change the\nways in which the content is distributed and the relationship between the\nmember stations and NPR in Washington.\n\nIf you're looking at consumer preference, the answer may not be the\nlocal affiliate's site. What then?\n\nIn this environment you cannot ultimately fight the tide of consumer\npreference. I think the good news is that that's the subject of open,\ntransparent, healthy conversation within the organization at this point.\n\nBut you think there's time to figure it out?\n\nThe speed in which our business is being challenged is very different than\nthat of most of our commercial brethren. It does so far have the advantage\nof not being forced to react to things in quite the same kind of time\nframe. [One reason is] our audience is growing. There is a tremendous\nopportunity for the local stations, particularly with newspapers suffering\nthe kind of staff cuts and reductions that they have, to become an even\nmore robust provider of news to their communities.\n\nDoes NPR offer something particularly valuable to digital news\nconsumers?\n\n[People] want analysis. I think they also want a connection with\nindividuals; they want to understand something about the person that\nstands behind the news report. I think the mix of authority and\nfamiliarity that NPR has managed to combine on air is something that\ntranslates very nicely to the Web, where the traditional, formal voice of\nauthority of a newspaper or even a traditional network television\nbroadcast does not meet the expectations of Web readers.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'All Things Considered Digitally'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},371:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Boxee Wants to Kill Your Television",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:"\nAvner Ronen thinks he can kill cable television. How? With software that\naggregates all the Web's video, music and media into a slick interface.\n\nWhat's more, Ronen thinks he can convince broadcasters and others to\nencourage cable's death by paying him a $.05 to $.10 fee every time\nsomeone watches or listens to something his software recommends.\n\n\"We think it becomes a cable replacement for a lot of young people,\" says\nRonen, who has raised $1 to $3 million for his New York-based start-up,\nBoxee.\n\nCrazy? Maybe. Gutsy? You bet. While there's no shortage of people looking\nto steal a television advertising market worth some \\$65 billion, Boxee's\nfive founders — who learned their trade working in the Israeli army —\nthink they can take advantage of content producers' need to find audiences\nby creating what is essentially a television with limitless channels and\nofferings that's easy to use. Kind of a personalized YouTube on your\ndesktop.\n\nBoxee's server makes recommendations to people based on their past\npreferences, the media stored on their hard drives and what friends from\nsocial networks prefer. Essentially, it \"moves\" content, creating an\nadvertising incentive for media to give him a cut of ad sales. Ronen\nargues, people — particularly kids — will instantly give up cable service\nif Internet media were easily aggregated in one place.\n\nAt the moment, there is little data to support his idea. But there is\nplenty that shows Web video is exploding. According to a study by\nForrester Research earlier this month, 40% of Internet users watch more\nthan an hour of online video a week, and some 55% of them are 13 to 34\nyears old. ABI Research reported the number of consumers watching video in\nan Internet browser doubled in the last year to some 63% in a study of 985\nhouseholds; comScore said in July that 75% of all Internet users are\nwatching video online; and Cisco Systems recently reported its expectation\nthat Internet traffic for video seen on a computer will account for some\n25% of all Internet traffic this year. It was 11% in 2006.\n\nStill, Howard Horowitz, whose Horowitz Associates researches the cable and\nInternet industries, says there are no real studies investigating a link\nbetween increasing Web video consumption and canceled cable subscriptions.\n\"In a linear sense, it's very hard to make a prediction,\" he says of how\nthe field develops. His data show cable subscriptions for the 18 to 34 set\nhave only decreased 10% since 2005, usually in favor of technologies such\nas digital cable. But a representative notes it's still in its early days,\nand Horowitz is continuing to study the topic in greater depth.\n\nRonen says the future is clear. And, he says, he's already found the\npeople who prove the point: Apple users (he is one). The famously young,\nhip group is ready to turn their iBooks and iMacs into televisions and\nstereos that tap all Internet media, he says. While Apple's Front Row\ntries to do it, Ronen says it fails by being tightly tied to the company's\niTunes media store. Boxee's first version has been written for the Mac.\n\nEarlier this month, they released instructions to easily upgrade (or hack)\nan AppleTV with their software. (They've also hacked Apple's remote to\nwork with it.) The company claims far more than 10,000 people are already\nusing Boxee in a private test and says a similarly sized group has signed\nonto a waiting list to join them. The software goes public later this\nyear.\n\nIf it sounds a bit grand, it is. Despite a novel business model, Boxee's\ngot its share of challenges ahead. The first is that, despite its claims,\nit doesn't currently aggregate all the Web's video — but it is getting\nbetter. This week it added CBS, Comedy Central, MySpaceTV and Hulu to its\nrepertoire. Ronen also says Boxee's in talks with all the major networks\nand content aggregators like Netflix to fix that. Why shouldn't they work\nwith him, argues Ronen, if he can find them viewers to increase the volume\nof ad sales.\n\nAnother equally thorny problem: To access all the media stored on a hard\ndrive, Boxee does not run inside a Web browser. Forcing people to download\nsoftware is increasingly impossible in an Internet world that accesses\ninformation and programs via the Web. The strategy just about killed off\nJoost — a high profile Web video portal that raised \\$40 million from the\nlikes of CBS and Viacom — earlier this year. Boxee is now working with\nJoost, which recently launched a browser version, on a new partnership.\n\nOne thing is for sure, Horowitz says. The stakes are as big as Ronen\nthinks. \"If big media is going to be complacent, they'll lose going\nforward.\"\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Boxee Wants to Kill Your Television'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},372:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"GodTube",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:'\nWhen Bobby Gruenewald joined LifeChurch.tv as a pastor in 2001, he turned\nto an obvious place to build membership: the Internet. A former technology\nexecutive, the daily tools of his trade are social media forums like\nFacebook and Twitter and a free iPhone application with a Bible translated\ninto 22 languages.\n\n"The church, the broader church, is finally seeing ways to engage with\npeople," says Gruenewald, who oversees all of his church\'s Web operations.\nWhile his 13-year-old evangelical organization has attendance of some\n23,000 people at 13 physical churches around the country, its online tools\nare a key element in attracting new members. And particularly important\nthese days are the 1,800 Web video streams it serves up on average for its\n11 weekly sermons.\n\nSome of the same forces destroying major media are changing the face of\neven the world\'s oldest media formats like sermons. From News Corp.\'s\nrecently acquired Beliefnet to the user-generated video start-up GodTube,\nthe Web is becoming an online hub for religious communication. As a\nresult, churches are using Web video to attract the next generation of\nparishioners.\n\n"I see a lot of people expecting it or asking for it," says Alex Hood, the\nCrossing Church\'s director of media and technology. Today, his Tampa,\nFla.-based evangelical church streams services to some 500 to 600 people\nevery weekend. Just 18 months ago, when Hood started, it was far smaller\nat only 150.\n\nThose numbers may be set to jump this month as churches capitalize on the\nChristmas season. Multicast Media, which negotiates discounted rates from\nthe content delivery network Akamai to stream these services for some 800\nmostly evangelical churches around the U.S., predicts it will serve up\nwell over 5,000 live streams this month.\n\nMost months average 4,000 — a number that already represents tremendous\nrecent growth. Alan Riley, director of Web operations, says the\neight-year-old company was averaging just 2,000 monthly streams 18 months\nago.\n\n"The growth has continued in spite of the economic slowdown," he says. No\nwonder. Religious groups are looking for younger parishioners, says\nQuentin Schultze, a communications professor focusing on religion at\nCalvin College in Michigan. The Internet has made competing for their\nattention harder than ever he says. The Internet is teaching people —\nparticularly younger ones — that they can demand convenience in how they\nconsume all types of messages, including religious ones.\n\n"I think that goes to the cultural shift of the younger generations coming\nup, and getting used to an on-demand lifestyle," says Greg Stielstra, who\njust co-wrote a book called Faith-Based Marketing: The Guide To Reaching\n140 Million Christian Consumers.\n\nOne big difference between media sites and religious ones: how long\nviewers stay tuned. Consider the Crossing Church where Hood reports\nviewers watch his streams for an average of 60 to 80 minutes. At\nLifeChurch.tv, the time is less at 25 to 35 minutes, but Gruenewald says\nthey are thrown off by massive accidental Web traffic of people he doesn\'t\naverage into his stream totals because they leave so quickly.\n\nThough it depends on the type of content in a broadcast, Dan Rayburn,\nexecutive vice president of StreamingMedia.com, says people often watch\nlive events online for 10 minutes or less.\n\nIt isn\'t all good news. Streaming Web video gets more expensive the more\npopular it becomes, so in the early days Rayburn says the cost of\ndelivering thousands of gigabytes per show to hundreds of people over the\nInternet can be relatively inexpensive based on rates that range as high\nas \\$0.50 per gigabyte. But the more people start tuning in, the bigger the\ncost becomes.\n\nAnd online viewers tend to donate less as well. At LifeChurch.tv people\ngive an average of $8 to$10 per week online — far lower than the $25-$35\nthey donate in person. Perhaps it\'s not surprising then that the church\nsees the format as a way to help drive people to physical locations,\nrather than a destination in itself.\n\n"We\'re not viewing it as how can we make it be the big revenue stream for\nthe church," says Gruenewald.\n',frontmatter:"headline: 'GodTube'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},373:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"How to Get Readers to Really Want You",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:"\nForget Anna Wintour, famed editrix of Vogue. Just like New York's Fashion\nWeek, which ended last Friday, she's so over. The big ideas for keeping\nVogue hot are coming from the business department down the hall — and it\nis betting big on the appeal of Web television.\n\nAt the top of the list: Model.Live, a 12-episode Web video series now\nplaying on Vogue.TV that follows three young women as they try to break\ninto the business while journeying to Fashion Weeks around the world. The\nshow has been viewed over a million times across the Internet since\nlaunching in late August.\n\nNot only is there original content under the Vogue name, but there's money\nbehind the effort too: The show is sponsored by EXPRESS.com and produced\nby IMG Sports & Entertainment. Vogue is coy about the numbers, but some\nreports place production costs at $3 million. With single magazine ad\n  pages going for as much as$121,000, show sponsors may be getting\nexclusive access toVogue's name — in full motion video — on the cheap.\n\nThat's quite a powerful advertising pitch for the magazine industry. Faced\nwith declining circulation and stagnant Web strategies, print products\nlike Vogue are becoming online television networks. Last week, Vogue-owner\nConde Nast launched Glamour.TV for Vogue's sister magazine.\n\n\"The advertisers are pursuing what's trendy,\" says Rebecca McPheters, a\nmagazine industry consultant. \"This way, the magazine publishers can say\nwe're aggressively growing and developing new media as well.\"\n\n\"Branded\" shows like Model.Live are an increasingly popular route into the\nWeb TV business. Unlike video ads sold against editorially created Web\nshows, advertisers work directly with business departments to create and\nunderwrite branded programs. It's a cost effective model because it\ndoesn't steal editors away from focusing on the print publication.\n\nThat is, after all, where Vogue still makes its money. Last year, the\nPublisher's Information Bureau reported it had roughly \\$419 million in\nsales from some 3,201 ad pages.\n\nPutting Vogue's business chief, publisher Tom Florio, in charge of content\nnamed afterVogue is a powerful example of how far magazines will go to\nreinvent themselves as powerhouse digital properties.\n\nTinkering with an editorial model that has kept Vogue printing for 116\nyears may be necessary. In the first six months of 2008, Vogue's paid\nsubscriptions fell 2.1% by dropping year-over-year to 782,397. More\ntroubling, Compete.com reports its Style.com Web site only had some\n565,000 unique visitors in August. That's not much compared to the almost\n4.8 million visitors at Glam.com, an Internet media upstart that caters to\nwomen about topics like fashion.\n\nA Vogue spokesperson counters that Compete’s numbers are unreliable and\nsays Conde Nast’s internal figures show some 1,474,340 unique visitors to\nStyle.com last month.\n\nStill, what seem clear is that dangerous fault lines are forming beneath\nsome of the industry's biggest names. Though Florio saysVogue is set to\nhave its second-best year of ad sales ever, he's worried about keeping the\nbrand relevant for the next generation of readers. So he — not Wintour —\nis creating Web shows like Model.Live with his 16-year-old daughter in\nmind.\n\n\"I'm comfortable with it, because I feel that the principals of what we're\ndoing are based on the same principals as the brand,\" he says. If Wintour\nobjected to the content, he says he would kill it. A Conde Nast\nspokesperson said that Wintour understands Vogue.TV is run by the business\ndepartment and stays informed about its programs. Wintour is attending\nFashion Weeks in Paris and Milan and was unavailable for comment.\n\nAt the helm of Vogue.TV, Florio is able to experiment with the medium in\nways Wintour can't by offering advertisers like Express a value the\nmagazin can't provide.\n\nFor instance, the clothing company sells clothes directly to the Vogue.TV\naudience in an e-commerce store that sits beside eachModel.Live video.\nExpress keeps the sales in an effort to avoid diluting Wintour's\nfashion-setting tastes. \"What we're doing is a cost-effective business\nmodel,\" says Florio.\n\nIf he can build a business off of these Web shows, the upside for Vogue\ncould be compelling. Web video portals are hungry to find fresh content\nthey can syndicate that isn't tangled up in the complex licensing rights\nthat often gum up deals with network or cable shows.\n\n\"I can assure you that Vogue did not give us their content for free,\" says\nTidalTV CEO Scott Ferber. His site is one of five Web video sites on which\nModel.Live is also being distributed. \"They are making money on it.\" That\ncould wind up being a sweet new source of revenue forVogue.\n\nStill, syndication fees like these are based on the reputation of Vogue\nand its editors — not partners like Express. That highlights the risk:\nThese new efforts could dilute the Vogue brand.\n\n\"I talk about the 'elasticity of content' — how far out can you take it to\nsatisfy advertisers is something of a concern for sure,\" says Tom Hartle,\nowner of the influential music magazine Spin. Also facing circulation\ndecline, his magazine is about to announce its own branded show about\ninternational music that will run in 63 markets worldwide. \"I think a lot\nof this innovation is coming out of the business departments and that can\nbe problematic to the healt of the brand,\" he says.\n\nFor now, the point may be moot. Florio says Vogue.TV's shows couldn't\nsurvive without the magazine's support. So, on second thought, don't\nforget about Wintour just yet.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'How to Get Readers to Really Want You'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},374:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Live, from the Internet",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:"\nSome 63.2 million television viewers tuned into the presidential debate\nTuesday night.

Sure. But while watching live news on the Web remains in\nits infancy, it is gaining ground. An ABI Research study of 985 people\nfound last month that video from news sites was the second most popular\ncategory of Web video, with just under 70% viewing it.\n\nConverting that interest into live news viewership via the Internet seems\nonly natural, particularly given its presence outside the home at places\nlike work. And live news coverage may be a real boon to Web sites because\nthe events have an instantaneous value that draws people immediately to\nthem.\n\n\"In the back of everyone's head is the thought that there's a new way to\nmake money here,\" says Joey Faust, a software solutions consultant for\nNational TeleConsultants, which builds production facilities for big media\nnetworks like the Fox Business Network. He says his clients are heavily\ninvesting in production facilities that can quickly, easily — and\nsimultaneously — distribute video content via traditional networks and the\nInternet.\n\nNews Corp. and General Electric's NBC Universal both show signs they agree\n— and that they want more online viewers than MySpace has delivered to\ndate. The two networks agreed this week to feed live video coverage of the\ndebates to their Hulu joint venture. Brenner says MySpace had no\ninvolvement in sister site Hulu's deal to showcase the debates live.\n\nHulu's broadcast was a first for the site, which in July was one of\ncomScore's top 10 Web video servers (it trailed MySpace umbrella Fox\nInteractive Media in the ranking). Citing company policy, a spokesperson\ndeclined to say how many viewers tuned in to the show. \"This is an\nexperiment in thinking about if live streaming is something people truly\nwant,\" says Hulu's Christina Lee.\n\nWhile MySpace is using the debate coverage to help raise its profile and\nattract more users, Hulu showed a 15- or 30-second paid ad before the\nstream started. The same will be done during next week's final debate.\nCuriously, NBC News provided the video feed this week and Fox News — also\nsupplying MySpace's feed — will provide it next week. Lee would only say\nboth investors offered their video feed to Hulu.\n\nHer company pushed the news value of the live video stream one step\nfurther than MySpace. It played roughly 10 minutes of NBC News' live\neditorial wrap-up after Tuesday's debate and may do the same with Fox News\nnext Wednesday. For now, that may be good news for news networks looking\nto expand audiences. Hulu expects to syndicate next week's debate across\nthe Internet by giving people a video player to embed on their own Web\nsites that will show it live.\n\nBut National TeleConsultants' Faust warns there is a flip side to the\nWeb-based video syndication model these moves represent. \"In this new\nmedia distribution model the brand is what brings you revenue,\" he says.\nAs a result, he says media businesses like Fox News may not ultimately be\nthrilled to have its identity wrapped inside a third-party entity, even\nthat of a sister company like MySpace.

He's signed roughly 40 correspondents and\nfive regional editors with pedigrees ranging from Time Magazine to the\nAssociated Press. Reporters in Asia and Eastern Europe are up next.\nEarlier this month, GNE stole Politico's Barbara Martinez as one of its\nmanaging editors.\n\n\"We are journalist entrepreneurs, and we have to find new models for\njournalism in the digital age,\" says Balboni.\n\nHe isn't alone. From Politico to Breaking Views to the Huffington Post to\nthousands upon thousands of blogs, droves of journalists have fled\ntraditional newsrooms in the past decade looking for a way to make a\nliving from the exploding world of digital media. So far, precious few\nhave replicated the quality or impact — or profits — of the name-brand\ncompanies they left behind.\n\nBut Balboni thinks he can, using the lure of ownership. His site is hiring\nthe five regional editors — for the Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe and the\nMiddle East — and some 72 correspondents located around the world. None of\nthem will be full-time employees. Instead, each is being lured by sizable\nequity stakes (not stock options) and a five-year guarantee of monthly\nfees of about \\$1,000. Correspondents will report to regional editors, who\nwill report to the 15-person GNE.\n\n\"Foreign correspondents used to be the stars of journalism,\" he says. Now\ncutbacks have left them starved for an outlet to fund — and market — their\nreporting. He thinks he can turn it around and doesn't shy away from the\nchallenge. It isn't his first long shot. Previously, Balboni founded and\nran New England Cable News, a joint venture between Hearst Corporation and\nComcast that provides some 3.6 million homes with 24/7 regional news\nprogramming.\n\nBut finding a large enough audience interested in international news to\nsupport these journalists could be even more difficult. comScore reports\nthat U.S.-based traffic accounted for 1.8 million unique visitors to the\nU.K. newspaper the Guardian in July. The numbers are far smaller in more\nfar-flung locales. For instance, Gurgaon, India-based the Times of India\nhad 321,000 unique U.S. visitors to its site in July. Moscow-based\nRussiaToday.com had 183,000 and the site for Tel Aviv, Israel-based\nHaaretz newspaper had 167,000.\n\nBalboni knows that growing the audience — and advertising base — to the\nsize needed to pay for all this is risky, especially because he's focused\non coverage outside of popular locations like England. So, similar to the\nmodel Politico is increasingly moving toward, GNE's multimedia content\nwill be sold to newspaper sites and other English-based sites around the\nworld. Balboni will only say syndicated content will be priced based on\ncirculation size and affordable to even his \"distressed colleagues.\" One\nlarge customer has already signed up, but Balboni won't identify it yet.\n\nBeyond that, Balboni expects to experiment with \"custom reporting\" — an\non-demand service where clients can hire GNE correspondents to generate\ncustom news reports.\n\nIt may be awhile before any of these businesses return any money though,\nand he knows it. Balboni is coasting on $8 million raised from private\n  investors such as Amos Hostetter Jr., chairman of Pilot House Associates\n  and the 147th richest American by our estimates, and Paul Sagan, president\n  of Akamai Technologies. Balboni says he's hoping to hit the originally\n  projected$10 million mark in funding, but he's been too busy hiring to\nraise money lately, he says.\n\nThe media entrepreneur thinks he has time. Balboni claims he isn't angling\nto quickly build and sell the company — another Silicon Valley mantra — to\nTime Warner or The New York Times Company or News Corp. or anyone else.\nBut with all the stock he's been printing to acquire journalistic talent,\nhe says he knows his reporters and editors will be keenly focused on the\nbottom line.

They did a lot more than go\nafter the billionaire they say ruined their company — you could make the\ncase that they've put the fast-changing newspaper business on trial, too.\n\nThe group says Zell, the Chicago real estate mogul-turned-newspaper-titan,\nhas done nothing but run down Tribune since buying it last year. But the\nsuit is so much more than an angry lashing by frustrated journalists. To\nthe group of well-known reporters that include two Pulitzer Prize winners,\nthe indictment of Zell is an angry answer to Wall Street's pessimism about\ntheir industry.\n\n\"The problem is not with the product, the problem is monetizing the\nproduct online,\" says Dan Neil, a five-year employee of the\nTribune-ownedLos Angeles Times. \"It's not journalism's problem, it might\nbe publishing's problem.\" Neil won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2004.\n\nLeading the charge from the LA Times newsroom, Neil and his cadre of\nplaintiffs are claiming various violations of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act (ERISA). Essentially, they allege that as members of\nTribune's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) — which became the legal\nowne of Tribune during a complicated buyout in April of 2007 — Zell has\nbreached his duty of loyalty to Tribune's employees. The group has asked\nthe court to certify the case as a class action.\n\nZell took over Tribune last year by taking it private in an $8.2 billion\ndollar deal that left the company with more than$13 billion dollars in\ndebt. In a statement Wednesday, Zell said the lawsuit \"is filled with\nfrivolous and unfounded allegations, and I hope every partner in this\ncompany is as outraged as I am at having to spend the time and money\nrequired to defend ourselves against it.\"\n\nA case like this seems inevitable. Zell has been something of a lighting\nrod for all that journalists fear about the future of newspapers since\ntaking over Tribune. He has evaluated reporters by how many column inches\nthey produce, turned editorial publications like the Los Angeles Times\nMagazine over to advertiser control and laid off at least 1,000 employees.\n\nAnd by all accounts, he has done it with little humility, famously cursing\nat a South FloridaSun-Sentinel staff member who challenged him in January\nduring an open question and answer session with employees. \"Zell has a\nreputation of being a very, very difficult person to deal with,\" says\nNeil. Yet, the long-time reporter admits he has never tried to contact\nZell about his grievances, saying such an effort would be futile.\n\nInstead, Neil was sucked into this case in July when the law firm that\nfiled it, Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, quietly approached him about\njoining. The firm had been working on the suit for some months along with\nplaintiff Henry Weinstein, a lawyer and 30-year veteran of theLA Times who\ncovered the legal beat before accepting a Tribune buyout this year.\nCotchett is no stranger to big class action cases. The 27-lawyer firm\nchampions its history of working on filing big claims, such as class\nactions alleging price fixing among ocean liners and complaints against\nMerrill Lynch for hiding subprim loan losses.\n\nIf all goes well, this case could be a major talking point for the firm.\nToluca Lake, Calif.-based Dish Communications, which describes itself as a\nboutique PR firm, was distributing copies of the complaint and\ncoordinating interviews with Neil earlier this week. There is quite a lot\nto talk about.\n\nThe ramifications of Zell's — and Tribune's — actions are defined by the\nCotchett firm as nothing short of the destruction of American democracy.\n\"Sam Zell exacted a severe, long-lasting damage to an institution that\ncitizens in a democracy rely on and require to effectively speak truth to\npower,\" writes lead lawyer Joseph Cotchett.\n\nZell himself is only named in two of the complaint's eight counts. Most\ncounts focus on Tribune's existing and past board of directors, as well as\nvarious trustees for the ESOP. The complicated structure of the multi-part\nbuyout deal may be the reason why. Zell was only personally involved in it\nduring an early stage loan to Tribune that funded the repurchase of some\nof its stock.\n\nAt that time, he allegedly convinced the ESOP to pay too much for Tribune\nin acquiring the rest of its public stock — $38 per share versus a more\nreasonable value of something under$10.\n\n\"The factual scenario is something of a novel one,\" says Ian Downes, an\nERISA litigator with the law firm Dechert. He says cases like this one\ncould drag on for years and can result in millions of dollars in\nattorney's fees for a plaintiff's firm involved in the suit.\n\nNewspapers have been under siege since the technology bubble popped in the\nlate 1990s, with problems ranging from declining circulation, advertiser\nconsolidation, classified ads migrating online, rising newsprint costs,\nbloated debt structures and, yes, over-staffing. Not to mention the rise\nof Internet news.\n\n\"The industry's got enough problems not to need bad management on top of\nit,\" says Neil.

Rupert Murdoch will be waiting.\n\nIn May, his Fox News subsidiary bought a minority stake in a Web\nvideo-based college news network featuring student reporters called\nPalestra.net. This fall, he'll be ramping up the partnership.\n\nIt's the latest — and boldest — move by a major media company to\ncapitalize on America's some 6.1 million undergrads. While outlets such\nasViacom's MTVU network and privately owned Zilo Networks have gone after\nuniversity students for years, Palestra's at the front of a new wave led\nby news outlets desperate to connect with young viewers.\n\nIn May, Disney's ABC News said it would open digital bureaus at some top\njournalism schools. And General Electric-owned NBC News recently announced\nit would be working with the New York Film Academy to train students in\ndigital journalism.\n\nPalestra.net goes further. Focusing on news, sports, business and\nentertainment features, it pays student reporters $240 to$300 to produce\nthree news packages a week for the Web site — and Fox's cable networks.\n\nMore than 10 pieces of student-reported Palestra content a week should be\nrunning on both the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network by the fall\nas the school year restarts and the presidential campaigns swing into high\ngear. And founder Joe Weasel — a former on-air journalist for NBC\naffiliate WCMH-TV in Columbus, Ohio — says he began talking with Fox's\nlocal affiliates last week about placing Palestra content on their Web\nsites around the country, which could lead to on-air spots.\n\nFox does not editorially preselect his network's coverage, says Weasel.\nLike most news organizations, reporters dig up stories that are pitched to\nPalestra producers, some of which are further pitched to Fox. And coverage\ndiverges from the stilted accounts that older, professional reporters\noften get from students when they arrive on campus for stories about the\nstudent vote.\n\nPalestra's reporters aren't just telling the stories — they are the story.\nWhen Weasel hired student reporters Sarah Barga, Sarah Jane Dugger and\nChri Kaechele as summer interns to create a marketing campaign for\nPalestra, Fox Business Anchor Alexis Glick had them brought to New York\nfor a segment on the internship. And while there, Weasel says the three\nhad a meeting with senior Fox officials about how they saw digital media\ndeveloping.\n\nThe relationship with Fox evolved in November 2007 partially from the\nsite's content — and partially from luck. When the campus of Pepperdine\nUniversity was burning along with Malibu, Calif., wildfires in October\n2007, Palestra reporter Stephan Holt (son of broadcast journalist Lester\nHolt) dispatched a 30-second news spot about where, and how, he and fellow\nstudents were being sequestered on campus for their safety.\n\nWeasel says the coverage helped catch the attention of Joel Cheatwood,\nnewly minted Fox News senior vice president of development. He had already\nbeen introduced to Palestra while working for CNN, as the site was\nproviding CNN.com free music coverage in 2006. While Weasel says the Cable\nNews Network hadn't seen his student demographic as important, Fox did,\nand after the wildfire coverage, a content partnership with the News Corp.\nentity began.\n\nFor his part, Cheatwood says advertisers want the news business to learn\nhow to reach young audiences not tuning into traditional broadcast and\ncable news programs — and to develop stories they value. Palestra's\nalready wide reach should help with that, as well as provide Fox a new\npipeline for talent.\n\nToday, Palestra fields a staff of 125 reporters at 101 schools around the\ncountry, placing News Corp. right at the heart of the nation's student\npopulation Weasel says that's a huge advertising market. Palestra viewers\nare growing quickly, with over two million people seeing it between Fox's\nvarious channels and online distribution. He would not provide any numbers\nbut says viewer growth online is accelerating quickly following the deal.\n\nAnd though Weasel says it's too early to see the results, Murdoch's\norganization has wasted no time in taking advantage of that access. Fox\nNews too over Palestra's ad sales around June, giving it access to new\naudiences and likely a slew of new sponsors who are attracted to them.\nWeasel declined to say how ad revenues would be split and said he could\nnot predict whether a full acquisition by Fox was in his company's future.\n\nWhile Palestra incorporated software-based video ad-serving technology\nfollowing the Fox investment, the student network previously focused on\nsponsorships over ad insertions based on automatic placement. For\ninstance, Pepsi has sponsored the show \"Music at the Palestra\" via a title\nscreen.\n\nThis isn't quite network news, though, as Weasel also says a sponsor like\nPepsi may have its products placed within the show, with reporters often\nwearing clothing with a Pepsi logo. Weasel acknowledges that the technique\ndoesn't work for every type of program — for instance, hard news — but the\none-time Ohio State University journalism professor says the tactic is\nfine for others.\n\nThere's another likely reason for News Corp.'s interest in Palestra:\nFacebook. The news network gives Murdoch a direct path to his MySpace\nrival. With student reporters using their own Facebook pages — and a\nPalestra.net company page — to post links and information about their\nonline and offline news reports, News Corp. gains a pathway to Facebook's\nwell-to-do, upwardly mobile college and university student users. Not bad\nfor a freshman.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Rupert Murdoch: Big Man on Campus'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},378:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Slowing Fast Company",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:"\nWhile layoffs and hiring freezes are the topic du jour at media companies\nacross New York City, Mansueto Ventures remains a bright spot in the\nindustry.

Seems like that gave you early\ninsight into the weakening market?\n\nJohn Koten: We had the Inc. 500 conference in Washington about a month\nago. It was interesting to be with those people at that time. It did have\nan impact on me because these are all very successful people and they were\nthere to celebrate the growth of their companies and yet there was a\nsomberness at the conference that I haven't seen in the time I've been at\nInc.\n\nAre your magazines particularly sensitive to the credit crunch of recent\nmonths?\n\nWe're writing for fast-growth companies, and fast-growth companies need\ncredit to maintain their growth, so if there's no credit and they can't\nexpand, the people we're writing for are going to be hurt.\n\nHow has that played out for your businesses this year?\n\nWe expected revenues to grow 20% to 25%, and they ended up growing across\nthe company between 8% and 12%. Because we put a lot of investment in\ndigital we expected our online revenues to grow faster than the rest of\nthe digital media industry. We decided to turn back now because the future\nis more uncertain over the next six months to a year than it [has been].\n\nAcross New York City, media is cutting jobs and tightening budgets, how\nmuch of it is cleaning up the ranks and how much of it is about lower\nrevenue expectations?\n\nI'd say half the people that no longer have jobs here were just redundant\nin the reorganization and about half are things we decided we're going to\nstop doing until our business grows more.\n\nWhat does the goal for three-year-old Mansueto Ventures become then?\n\nOur goal is to increase market share when times are difficult, so I think\nas long as we're showing progress we'll be OK.\n\nCombining print with digital will help you with that? Why?\n\nThere's an incentive if you're in the digital department to keep what\nyou're doing close to your vest because it makes you the expert. I want\neveryone to know what our top 10 stories that generated the most traffic\nare each month, and I want the editors of the Web sites to share this\ninformation.\n\nI want the editor of Fastcompany.com and the editor of Inc.com — neither\nof whom have been named yet and the Fast Company job is still up for grabs\n— I want them to put out a weekly or monthly report saying here's what\ndrove our traffic this month.\n\nWe have these big video screens to help layout the magazine, but I'm\nthinking of converting them over to something we can use to report\ndigitally ... what's happening with traffic.\n\nSo in your mind the combination is a response to tougher economic times\nand a way to fuel digital growth?\n\nIf anything, you could view this as a shift of resources from the print\nmagazines to the online department because they're [reporters and editors]\nnow going to be working 20% to 30% online. They do a lot of reporting, but\n[right now] they're thinking about just what they're going do for the\nmagazine and they're not thinking about how they might leverage that\nonline.\n\nI've told every employee here that at the end of the year I want a memo\nexplaining if [they] were an online employee how [they're] going to\ncontribute to print and if [they're] a print employee, I want to know how\n[they're] going to contribute to online.\n\nIf I'm a journalist, I need to be able to do online, print, video, audio —\nwhatever the heck is out there. I wanted to start a super- reporter\nprogram here, where we took two reporters from digital, two reporters from\nFast Company and two reporters from Inc. and have them cross-train like\nhell to create a super-reporter who could wear all nine hats. Then I\nthought: Why shouldn't everybody be doing that?\n\nThe story is bigger than just what the journalists do as storytellers\nthough, isn't it?\n\nI think social publishing is going to play a bigger and bigger role in\njournalism whether we professional journalists like it or not.\n\nThe professional journalist becomes a coach and a mentor to people who are\ndoing this [blogging and writing] for free. Our strength is trying to be\nthe spokesman into communities and trying to build a business that works\naround that.\n\nThen, the future of media/digital is about highlighting ideas and\nopinions, not flat factual reporting?\n\nI think people with strong intelligent voices will find a way to monetize\nthose voices in the future, but I don't know that people who are just\nfollowing the traditional journalistic approach of gathering information\nand then presenting it in a stylistically pleasing way [are] going to\nsurvive. It's too dull.\n\nAnd that will help you grow revenues through a recession?\n\nHaving regularly updated, fresh content is different than having people\nwho are trying to break stories five or six times a day. I don't really\nsee us as a news-oriented media company at all. With social publishing,\nyou could invest in technology in a way that can help to boost your\ntraffic and on a dollar-for-dollar basis that may be a better investment\nthan investing in originally created content.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Slowing Fast Company'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},379:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Strapped Local Sations Look to Web for Cash",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:"\nLocal television stations need some good news. Just this month, the\nTelevision Bureau of Advertising announced spot TV advertising would fall\nthis year roughly 7% — despite the lucrative presidential election. Next\nyear looks bleak too: It predicted 7% to 11% declines. Those are big\nnumbers in an industry that's used to clearing roughly \\$65 billion in\nadvertising.\n\nWhile the decline is due in part to a recession, the bigger reason is more\nsystemic. Advertisers have more outlets than ever to choose from. So what\nare local stations to do? Increasingly, they're turning for salvation in\nthe usual direction: the Internet.\n\nThere are reasons for stations' emboldened outlook. Ion Puspurica, who has\nspent a decade helping build and manage hundreds of local television Web\nsites, says some 30% of TV stations have managed to increase online\nrevenues to a point where they matter.\n\n\"If you get to the point where they can generate 5% or above on their\nbottom line, then they really pay attention to you,\" Puspurica says. As\ngeneral manager of Critical Media's broadcast services group, he is now\nselling a service to stations that simplifies their ability to post\nbroadcast video feeds on the Internet.\n\nDriven by increased consumer use of online video over the last year and a\nhalf, stations are pushing hard to turn it into a moneymaker. \"We're\ngetting a lot of pressure from our clients to sell their Web sites, and to\nsell them uniquely,\" says Garnett Losak, who's company, Petry Media, sells\nadvertising and builds programming schedules for local stations.\n\nMany local stations not only compete with other stations, but also fight\nwith local newspapers for ad dollars. Every day a station doesn't push\nmore of its resources online is another day a competitor might. With fewer\nand fewer viewers tuning in to local newscasts, Adam Symson, vice\npresident of interactive for E.W. Scripps' television division, which owns\n10 stations, says building online audiences is imperative.\n\nConsider ABC affiliate KCRG in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. While it internally\ntracks an average of seven million unique visitors per month, and streams\nits noon newscast to an average of 9,000 people per day, the two-year-old\nsite only earned some \\$500,000 last year. \"It's got to grow. It just\nabsolutely has to grow,\" says the station's general manager John Phelan,\nnoting there will be no real political ads next year.\n\nHe hopes to double revenue in 2009, and for several years thereafter, with\na new sales program. He's finalizing a system where his nine sales people\nwill be penalized if they do not meet monthly Web revenue goals. \"At this\npoint, you have to try something different,\" he says.\n\nGiving sales staff incentives to sell the Web remains a huge problem, says\nSteve Ridge, president of media strategy at television consultancy Frank\nN. Magid Associates. And there is no consistency on how to approach the\nissue — whether via separate sales reps or a unified sales force.\n\nBut Web sites continue to be a bet on the future for most stations, rather\nthan a quick fix for flagging ad sales. \"[Stations] don't realize how much\neffort, resources and time it takes for that business to develop,\" says\nScott Blumenthal, executive vice president of television at Lin TV. His\ncompany, which owns 29 local television stations, is very focused on the\nInternet. While the company has struggled this year, digital has been a\nbright spot, growing in the first nine months of the year to $19.7\n  million, from$10.1 million last year.\n\nThose are results other stations are likely looking to emulate. For\ninstance, Robert Forsyth, director of Internet operations at Albritton\nCommunications, says the company has spent the last year rebuilding the\ntechnology system underlying its 12 Web properties, including eight\ntelevision stations. With 70,000 to 80,000 videos streaming from his sites\nper month — many of which will soon be in high definition — and 75 to 100\nnew videos published per day, Forsyth says increasing online ad dollars\nremains a priority for 2009.\n\nBut local advertising consultant Gordon Borrell of Borrell Associates says\nhe's worried some stations have a mismatched expectation for how quickly\nthe Internet can become a significant piece of their business.\n\nHis firm surveyed 647 television stations, and many are setting Web\nbudgets for next year based on massive increases in online revenue\nexpectations. In one case, the number is seven times greater than 2008\nrevenue. Borrell says, \"I'm kinda wondering how they're going to do that.\"\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Strapped Local Sations Look to Web for Cash'\npublication: 'Forbes'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},380:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"The Paperless Town",publication:"Forbes",position:"Staff reporter"},body:'\nAn odor of death clings to the newspaper industry. According to Editor &\nPublisher, seven American newspapers shut down between 2003 and 2007. With\nover 13,000 jobs lost from the industry over the past year, according to\nonline layoff tracker Paper Cuts, that number is poised to grow.\n\nAcademics and journalists predict the worst. Government will run amok,\ninformation will not be traded and the "nagging conscience of a community"\nwill be lost, says Conrad Fink, the Morris chair of Newspaper Strategy and\nManagement at the University of Georgia.\n\nBut looking at some of the big and small communities where those seven\npapers shut down shows there may be less impact than you might expect.\nMany readers turned away from newspapers long ago. In the Internet age,\ninformation overload, rather than starvation, is the main lament of most\nnews consumers. "What you\'ve seen as to closures recently has been simply\nmarginal operation falling prey against combined competitive threats,"\nsays Fink.\n\nJohn Leone, a former mayor of Bristol, Conn., and the president of the\nGreater Bristol Chamber of Commerce, knows the feeling. His town faces the\nclosure of The Bristol Press, circulation 8,285. The imploding Journal\nRegister Company said in early November that it may close the paper, and\nThe Herald, circulation 9,646, of New Britain if it can\'t sell them.\n\n"There\'s so many other ways to get your message out, I can understand the\nproblem of keeping [it] open," he says, though he doesn\'t like it — some\n50 years ago, he was a paperboy for the Press. "The reality is that some\nof the other newspapers in the area will probably step it up."\n\nThat\'s what happened to the Post-Herald in Birmingham, Ala. Owned by E.W.\nScripps Company, the 7,500 circulation afternoon daily closed in September \n2005.\n\n"Certainly, losing a voice in the community has an impact, but that\nvoice had become less influential as the paper had shrunk," says Tom\nScarritt, editor of the rival Birmingham News, which has a circulation of\n137,220. His paper was handling most of the Post-Herald\'s non-editorial\noperations, including ad sales under a Joint Operating Agreement at the\ntime.\n\nAnd how did local businesses react to the closure? Maggie Krost, the News\'\nvice president of sales and marketing says they didn\'t. "I think it had no\nimpact on the business community at all from the perspective of being able\nto reach the marketplace with advertising," she says.\n\nIn De Queen, Ark., the De Queen Daily Citizen was shut down by new owner\nLancaster Management in 1997. With a circulation of roughly 2,650, Mayor\nBilly Ray McKelvey says the paper had been a labor of love of local scion\nRay Kimball for years.\n\nDe Queen\'s 5,765-person community loved the paper too. McKelvey, who was\nonce its editor and worked there for 18 years, says people used to pick it\nup in the morning and sit around the local courthouse discussing the day\'s\nevents. "I can tell you the community did not like losing the daily\nnewspaper. There were lots of howls," he says.\n\nBut not as much changed in the aftermath as one would have thought. True,\nthere are no more courthouse news gatherings. And local flower shop owner\nJoanie Paterson says her funeral business was cut in half by some \\$10,000\nbecause the elderly stopped learning of deaths soon enough to send\nflowers. But she says she can\'t think of any other local businesses\nsimilarly impacted, although folks living in the town\'s rural outskirts —\nlike her father — have trouble getting the news.\n\nThe local radio station\'s Web site has become a major spot for community\nnews, a weekly newspaper (the daily\'s sister paper) still operates, and\nthe Texarcana Gazette has stepped up its coverage in the area. And\nPaterson is putting up a new marquee outside her store with a spot on it\nto advertise store promotions.

Calling the number "hugely pre-emptive,"\nhe said Take Two’s demand for a higher bid was unrealistic.\n\nJenson declined to comment on whether management has discussed offering\nmore. Take Two’s stock price was USD 17.36 last Friday, the last trading\nday before the offer was publicly disclosed.\n\nLast week, a top Take Two shareholder told this news service that USD 30\nper share was a more realistic price. He cited the upcoming 29 April\nrelease of Grand Theft Auto 4 and other cost-cutting measures that Take\nTwo has said have not yet been recognized by the market.\n\n"It’s a dance, right," said EA’s Jenson of Take Two’s rejection of the\noffer. "There’s not a shred of historical evidence to show that is the\ncase," he said of assertions that Grand Theft Auto 4 sales would\ndramatically change Take Two’s value.\n\nAs the seventh version of the game, Jenson said there is plenty of data to\npredict sales. While he said EA may not dramatically increase its US and\nUK sales, it could in more far-flung markets such as Spain or Russia.\n\n"They’re [EA] very serious here," said Kaufman Brothers analyst Todd\nMitchell. "They took some money out of short term investments and put it\ninto cash." Still Mitchell said he remains unconvinced a deal will close\nas the Take Two acquisition is not an imperative for EA.\n\n"If they overpay for this thing, people are going to smell desperation,"\nhe said.\n<br /> EA’s Jenson said it may drop the size of its bid if Take Two does\nnot act quickly enough.\n\nHe warned that the pressure is on to finish a deal in order to integrate\nTake Two’s management into EA in time for this year’s holiday season. The\nperiod can account for some 40% of video game sales, he said.\n\n"We just don’t need both," he said in reference to overlap in EA’s and\nTake Two’s management. Creative personnel may be a different story.\n\nRockstar Games – the Take Two publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series –\nis a "significant part of this transaction," said Jenson. Yet the value of\nRockstar is said by some to be tightly aligned with Sam Houser, its\npresident, and his brother, Dan Houser, vp creative.\n\n"Everyone acknowledges the Housers are the glue that keeps this [Grand\nTheft Auto] together," said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush\nMorgan Securities.\n\nBut it is unclear whether the two would be willing to move to EA –\nparticularly with a contract that is said to\n\ngive them a cut of gross revenues from Take Two’s Grand Theft Auto sales.\n"The myth is they get 15% of revenues," said Pachter, "I think that’s\nprobably right."\n\nWith that standard dangling before employees – and a history of building\ncontroversial themes such as sex into Grand Theft Auto – Pachter\nquestioned whether EA would want the two in-house. Earlier this week,\nPachter publicly suggested that EA split Rockstar off into a separate\ncompany to avoid some of these issues.\n\n"The analysts see Rockstar and they see risk," said EA’s Jenson. "We see\nRockstar and we see opportunity."\n\nWhile he said he had some understanding of the Housers’ contracts, he\ndeclined to specify what that was.\n\nInstead, he said he believed that the Housers would be comfortable working\nwithin EA.\n',frontmatter:"headline: 'EA standing firm on USD 26 offer'\npublication: 'FT.com'\nposition: 'Staff reporter'"}},382:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Breaking News Online",publication:"Seton Hall Magazine",position:"Freelance"},body:"\n“When I started, I was told this is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And\nI laughed. Now I’m not too sure it was a joke.”\n\nAdam Desiderio ’05 laughs again. The 29-year-old associate producer with\nthe “NBC Nightly News” is like a lot of journalists. He disarms quickly by\npoking fun at himself and speaking plainly about almost anything. Being a\nbit over 6 foot 3 inches tall with a handsome face and thoughtful demeanor\ndoesn’t hurt either. The package seems just right for NBC’s flagship news\nshow.\n\nDesiderio is one of some six young Seton Hall University alumni working\nacross NBC’s news outlets at a time of incredible tumult. Like most media,\nthe fabled “peacock network” is remaking itself for the digital age. This\nsummer alone, it launched NBCLatino.com, used mobile apps to supplement\nits London Olympics coverage, and bought Microsoft’s 50 percent stake in\nMSNBC.com.\n\nThe result is a constant if soft drumbeat for these new alumni to reinvent\nthemselves just as swiftly.\n\n“You have to be really nimble,” says Robert Windrem ’68, a senior\ninvestigative producer who covers terrorism for the “NBC Nightly News.”\n\nWhen Windrem started in 1980, he could only tell a story by airing a piece\non the evening news, the early morning “Today” show, or a prime-time news\nmagazine. Now he also regularly produces Web news videos, writes for\nMSNBC.com (now NBCnews.com), and discusses international security as a\nguest on NBC’s various cable news networks.\n\n“Everyone understands these opportunities exist,” says Windrem, 67.\n\nBrian Wisowaty ’11 agrees. In June, after just a year at MSNBC as a\ngraphics production assistant, the 23-year-old was asked to oversee\nvisuals for the prime-time show, “PoliticsNation.” That means he\ncoordinates the senior producers who decide what information to illustrate\nand the artists who make it look good. Wisowaty ensures they both hit the\nmark.\n\n“This is no longer something that just flashes up on-screen,” he says.\nShow producers are now posting his images to Facebook in order to connect\nwith the social network’s 950 million members.\n\nThe move offers a tangible reminder that digital media is changing TV.\n\nBy the early 2000s, many predicted the Internet would put an end to it.\nThat never happened. But the Internet’s popularity also never stopped\ngrowing. Each spurt pushes TV news to change just a little bit more. The\nresults can be quite dramatic.\n\nBetty Nevins ’77, senior production manager for “Meet the Press,” offers a\ngood example. The famed Sunday morning political program has developed an\noriginal Web video series named “PRESS Pass.” It only takes six or so\npeople to create each segment. That’s a far cry from the roughly 28 people\nNevins, 56, leads each week to broadcast the main program nationally.\n\n“They’re breaking the mold,” says the 27-year NBC veteran.\n\nBy redefining what qualifies as professional- grade video, “Meet the\nPress” can afford to recruit new viewers online with stories it normally\ncouldn’t do. For instance, host David Gregory was able to interview\nactress Sigourney Weaver in July about her new cable mini-series,\n“Political Animals.”\n\nIt’s an evolution that Erin Ganley ’09 navigates daily. As a line\nproducer for MSNBC’s “The Ed Schultz Show,” her days begin with the\ncreation of a show schedule and end in a rush to get people to stick to it\nduring broadcast. That doesn’t always leave the 25-year-old as much time\nto focus on the Internet as she’d like.\n\n“I don’t think it has as much of a role with the job I have right now,”\nshe says. But she’s sure it will in the future, so she keeps up with\ndigital media on her own.\n\nTake her use of Twitter, the online social network that relays news in 140\ncharacter bursts. Ganley frequently scans it to filter through the day’s\ntop stories.\n\nShe may be on to something. In July, corporate parent Comcast reorganized\nNBC by creating the NBCUniversal News Group to house all of its broadcast,\ncable, and Internet news outlets under one chairman. The goal: increase\ncollaboration.\n\nIt’s the type of step forward that keeps Stephanie Wightman ’08 excited\nabout TV. Like all her young alumni-colleagues, the 26-year-old tape\nproducer for “1st Look,” an early morning NBC news show, is always keen to\nadapt to change gracefully.\n\nAs she says: “You’ve got to go where the future is.”\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Breaking News Online'\npublication: 'Seton Hall Magazine'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},383:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Cracking the College Code",publication:"Seton Hall Magazine",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nLast winter, 15 students from Newark’s Technology High School took part in\na six-month pilot program from Seton Hall’s Center for Mobile Research and\nInnovation. The “Young Developers Program” had a simple, yet important\ngoal: prepare the students — who hail from a traditionally underprivileged\ncommunity — to design and build mobile apps for smartphones and tablet\ncomputers on their own.\n\n“That’s of value no matter what you decide to do,” says associate\nprofessor of political science Michael Taylor, the CMRI’s academic\ndirector.\n\nThat’s probably true. Mobile devices are booming. In 2007, smartphones\nwere relatively rare and tablet computers were non-existent. Today, just\nsix years later, the United States has amassed 140 million smartphone and\n123 million tablet users, reports eMarketer, a tech consultant. As a\nresult, these devices have penetrated nearly every walk of life.\n\nBut not all teens are being given the skills and confidence needed to\nharness these forces.\n\nThe Young Developers program was designed to help by teaching students\nfrom disadvantaged areas to build mobile apps — a form of software — for\nsmartphones and tablets. Each of its 12 lessons, which range from computer\nlogic\n\nto user interfaces, includes a video lecture, in-class coding problem and\ntake-home lab. A \\$250,000 corporate gift from AT&T paid for the\ncurriculum, as well as smartphones and laptop-tablet hybrids running\nMicrosoft Windows.\n\nThe Newark Tech teens were also responsible for building their own mobile\napps. All told, it was a lot of work.\n\nTo keep them on track, the students were paired with mentors from Seton\nHall who had a similar socio-economic background. “I’ve lived in poverty,\nand I’ve seen poverty,” says Franck Nelson ’13, one of the six\nundergraduate mentors.\n\nA biology major, Nelson immigrated from Haiti to Trenton, N.J., when he\nwas 14. He joined the Young Developers pilot to offer tangible proof that\nnothing is out of reach. While the program’s focus is on coding, Nelson,\nwho just started a graduate program at Seton Hall’s College of Nursing,\nsays mentors spent as much time talking about college.\n\n“We had people believe in us to get here,” he says. “We believe we can\nreturn the favor.”\n\nTaylor, who is now running a second pilot project in Newark and trying to\nraise more money from AT&T to expand to two more cities in the next year,\nsays the program’s first run ended with an unexpected surprise. He wasn’t\nsure if all the teens would finish their software. But they did, on their\nown or in a small group, building 12 apps. “A lot of them weren’t\nsatisfied by what they created,” he adds.\n\nThat’s just fine.

It pulses, and music plays out of the\nthin air above it. Jose Lopez, the newest addition to Seton Hall’s\nDepartment of Physics, shows visitors his plasma speaker with a smile. The\n34-year-old assistant professor of physics likes a good attention-grabber.\n\n“In physics, we have very bad PR. We make it seem that it’s not\naccessible,” he says.\n\nIn a field forever dominated by Albert Einstein’s loopy personal style,\nLopez is an unexpected twist on the age-old vision of a brainy physicist.\nThe chatty Newark native is warm, amiable and plainspoken. And yet, one of\nthe 20 biggest brains in the state, according to Inside Jersey magazine,\nis also an expert in a little-known, but potentially up-and-coming field\nof study called microplasmas. Lopez creates these tiny plasma reactions in\norder to assemble chemicals as if they were made of Lego blocks.\n\nThat’s not as crazy as it sounds. Most people know there are three states\nof matter: solid, liquid and gas. Each is defined by the density and\narrangement of the atoms within it. Plasma is a fourth state that occurs\nwhen gases destabilize. That means their atoms break up into a mixture of\ncharged ions and electrons.\n\nOnce free, these ions and electrons can be recombined into something new.\nLopez studies ways to control them. “That’s the whole thing,” says Alfred\nFreilich, a longtime Lopez collaborator who joined Seton Hall with him in\n2011\n\nas a visiting research professor. It’s hard to reliably control plasma.\nIt’s hot — the sun and stars are made of it. And atoms like stability. On\nEarth, they don’t shift to plasma easily. Generally, a vacuum is needed to\ncoax them. They shift to\n\nit more easily in miniature. At scales of a millimeter or less, chemical\nelements will become plasma in the open air and at a temperature cool\nenough to touch.\n\nAs a result, there may be a lot of ways to put these tiny plasmas to work.\nLopez and Freilich look for them.\n\nFor instance, Degrémont Technologies uses their research to increase the\namount of oxygen it can turn into ozone inside of school bus-sized\nmicroplasma reactors. Municipalities and other groups buy the reactors so\nthey can kill bacteria with ozone rather than chlorine at their\nwater-treatment plants. The ozone is produced on-site because it breaks\ndown soon after it’s created.\n\nThe oxygen alchemy is cool, but Lopez uses the reactors to connect more\nthan just electrons and ions.\n\nHe also uses them to connect with people. By forcing a lot of tiny oxygen\nplasmas to create ozone, the reactors remind people that physics doesn’t\njust explain how the universe works. It also offers keys for controlling\nit.\n\nSo, when Degrémont asked for help on its microplasma reactors in 2005,\nLopez opted to make the field a long-term focus. At the time, he was\njoining the physics faculty at his alma mater, Saint Peter’s University in\nJersey City, N.J.\n\nThat found the newly minted academic looking for a way to connect with\nstudents directly.\n\nLopez already knew something about drawing students into science. Kurt\nBecker, his doctoral adviser at the Stevens Institute of Technology in\nHoboken, N.J., noticed that shortly after Lopez arrived in 2000. Becker\noften opened his lab to local high school and college students looking for\nhands-on research experience. They all flocked to Lopez.\n\n“It was almost his natural instinct to take them under his wing,” says\nBecker.\n\nThat’s not surprising. By then, Lopez had been teaching science for years\n— he tutored the entire women’s varsity basketball team in math and\nscience while a sophomore at Saint Peter’s.\n\nBut he did learn some new tricks under Becker, now the associate provost\nfor research and technology initiatives at the Polytechnic Institute of\nNew York University. Becker treated doctoral students like colleagues, not\nemployees. He encouraged them to story their own interests, and tried to\nget them whatever they needed to do it.\n\n“If someone had a good idea, my attitude was: Go try it out,” he says.\n\nBecker’s stance had a long-term effect on Lopez. Nothing is out of reach.\nLast spring, he applied the theory to one of his first courses at Seton\nHall. Rather than limiting his class on waves and oscillations to the\nuniversity’s labs, he added a set of online video lectures from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe result really stood out to junior Stacie Ballou. The lectures gave her\na first-hand look at the type of experiments normally confined to big\nresearch universities. “It was a different experience,” she says.\n\nFor Lopez, that was the point. Students aren’t unlike the chemicals he\nassembles in microplasma.\n\nThey’re ready to become something new — if you can connect with them.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Giving Physics a Good Name'\npublication: 'Seton Hall Magazine'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},385:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"The Bone Doctor's Knees",publication:"Seton Hall Magazine",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nIt all started in the mid-’70s on scrap paper: cocktail napkins, lined\nyellow paper, whatever was near. Frederick Buechel ’67, M.D., and Michael\nPappas, Ph.D., were designing artificial joints. They worked on schematics\nwherever they were, sometimes even at a bar near their homes in northern\nNew Jersey. For Buechel, the work has never been far from his mind.\n\n“To this day, you’ll see a piece of paper on his desk with a drawing on\nit,” says his son, Frederick Buechel Jr., M.D. That’s no surprise. His\nfather is the co-inventor of one\n\nof the world’s best-known artificial knees. It was one of the first to\ntruly simulate the real thing — bending up and down while also twisting a\nlittle left and right as people walk. A version of it has been sold by\nDePuy Orthopaedics for more than 30 years. First known as the New Jersey\nKnee, it’s now called the N.J. LCS® Mobile Bearing Total Knee System.\n\n“You should allow the ligaments and muscles to act in their own normal\nway,” says Buechel Sr., 67.\n\nWhile DePuy, now part of Johnson & Johnson, doesn’t discuss market share,\nit has been reported that the LCS Knee has been chosen by a million people\nworldwide. That’s a number that could grow rapidly. Knee replacements are\nincreasingly common. Between 2000 and 2011, the number of operations grew\nalmost 130 percent, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says,\nwith more than 600,000 done each year in the U.S. alone.\n\n“It’s a hot topic,” says Daniel Brown, an orthopedic devices analyst at\nMillennium Research Group.\n\nThere are at least two reasons. People younger than 65 increasingly want\nto temper sport and other high-impact injuries, and those who are older\nare staying active longer.\n\nBut, in 1974, none of that was true yet.\n\nBuechel, then a 28-year-old orthopedic resident at New Jersey Medical\nSchool (now a part of Rutgers University) was overseeing a research\nproject on an ankle-replacement device. “Many of these were developed in\npersonal labs, almost in garages,” says Stuart Hirsch, M.D., a clinical\nprofessor of orthopedics at Seton Hall’s School of Health and Medical\nSciences.\n\nThe orthopedic surgeon has known Buechel since organizing a panel of knee\ndesigners for the New Jersey Orthopaedic Society about 30 years ago. Other\npresenters had more elite credentials, but Buechel’s dynamic,\ndata-driven presentation stood out. “I immediately switched over to the\nNew Jersey Knee,” says Hirsch.\n\nWhen Buechel first began work on his ankle replacement he sought help from\nPappas, at the time a 41-year-old mechanical engineer teaching at New\nJersey Medical School. “Any problem that I’m capable of solving is of\ninterest,” says Pappas, now 80.\n\nBuechel’s decision to ask for help wasn’t entirely surprising. The young\ndoctor, who won four New Jersey Amateur Athletic Union and three\nMetropolitan Intercollegiate Wrestling Championships while at Seton\nHall, liked a challenge — if evenly matched. Once he started working on\nthe replacement ankle, he realized he wasn’t well matched; he hadn’t\nthought about the technical aspects of building the device.\n\nPappas’s engineering know-how evened the odds.\n\nBy 1976, the two men were building joints on their own time. Their focus\nshifted to shoulders, and they were also considering the knee. Then, good\nluck struck. Buechel presented a paper about their shoulder at a\nconference, and caught the attention of an executive from DePuy, who\nwanted to license it.\n\nBuechel saw his shot, and made DePuy promise to sign a contract to sell\nhis artificial knee too. Bold move, as there was no knee yet.\n\nBut DePuy agreed.\n“You can’t live without being a business person,” says Buechel.\n\nDevelopment began. Buechel defined problems, Pappas designed solutions. At\nthe time, artificial knees had two major components. One attached to the\nfemur, a hip-to-knee bone; the other to the tibia, a knee-to-ankle bone.\nThese “fixed-bearing knees” bent like a hinge, but Bueche and Pappas\nweren’t satisfied by the results. Then a new idea arrived from a group\nfrom Oxford in the United Kingdom. It offered a way to make a knee that\ncould both bend and turn a bit. Buechel and Pappas quickly adopted this\n“mobile-bearing” design, and worked to improve it.\n\nBy 1977, their mobile-bearing knees were a lot like the real thing, and in\ntheory, would last longer than the fixed-bearing kind. DePuy, which sells\nboth types, says one independent study found that, after 15 years of use,\nBuechel’s LCS Knee still was in good shape 97 percent of the time.\n\n(The Buechel-Pappas partnership with DePuy ended some time ago, but the\nmen still work together on their own.)\n\nStill, knees are big business, and the technology keeps improving. Debates\nabout which type is best remain some of the hottest at orthopedic\nconferences today, says Millennium’s Brown, the device analyst.\n\nBuechel, always ready for a good challenge, is prepared to defend the\nmerits of his knee.\n\nThe doctor clearly likes his odds.\n",frontmatter:"headline: The Bone Doctor's Knees\npublication: Seton Hall Magazine\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},386:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"The Clean Air Catalyst",publication:"Seton Hall Magazine",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nThe FedEx package from John Mooney ’55 arrives less than a week after our\nfirst meeting. Mooney — an 83-year-old man with a nimble step — has sent\ntwo reports.\n\nHe wrote the first paper for the United Nations in 2004 to convince a few\nholdout countries to eliminate lead from their gasoline. The other is a\nnew paper out of the University of Michigan asking if the 230 million or\nso automobiles in the United States represent a peak. (Unlikely.)\n\nMooney, a chemical engineer, chose the reports to illustrate how\ndangerous internal combustion engines can be. But something else is\npresent in the reports: Mooney’s passion for tough problems — and\ninnovative solutions.\n\n“If you don’t think there’s a solution, then you just haven’t asked the\nright question,” says daughter Elizabeth Convery, quoting a mantra her\nfather often tells his five children and 14 grandchildren to live by.\n\nThat fits. Mooney is the co-inventor of the three-way catalytic converter,\na small exhaust-cleaning device that hangs beneath about 80 percent of\nautomobiles. Each converter destroys about 98 percent of a car’s three\nmost noxious emissions — simultaneously.\n\nThree-way catalytic converter\n\n“That was a phenomenon that no one else thought was possible,” says\nMooney.\n\nNot for lack of interest. By the late ’60s, thick smog around Los Angeles\nsparked public demand for cleaner air, says Joseph Kubsh, executive\ndirector of the Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA). An\nextension of the 1963 Clean Air Act was on its way in 1970, with the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and emissions standards in tow.\n\nThe standards would force most automakers to add a catalytic converter to\ntheir cars. A lot of companies wanted to sell it to them. That included\nEngelhard, Mooney’s then employer, a chemical company based in Iselin,\nN.J., now part of BASF.\n\nBut a good device wasn’t so easy to build.\n\nThe chemical reactions that clean up a car’s most noxious pollutants are\nvery different. Oxygen has to be stripped away from nitrous oxide, but\nmust also be added to carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons. Most\nthought this would require a bulky, two-stage system.\n\nMooney thought he could do it in one. He proved it by doing something\nunexpected.\n\nRather than looking at the exhaust, he focused on the gasoline being fed\ninto the engine. If it was mixed with the right amount of air, the exhaust\nwould offer a one-stage converter just enough oxygen to simultaneously\nrender all three pollutants harmless.\n\nMooney’s discovery seemed like magic. “No one really believed me,” he\nsays. “Probably our competitors didn’t either.” But Mooney was never one\nto give up easily. Take his first car, a 1941 Ford convertible he bought\nin 1949 to carry him to Seton Hall University, where he was starting work\non an undergraduate degree in chemistry. The car worked — but not\nwellenough. So Mooney, 19, took its engine apart, leaving more than 100\npieces scattered across a friend’s garage. Problem was, he didn’t know\nwhat they did.\n\nThat was no problem. Mooney talked to some mechanics, and soon knew what\nhe had to do. The big V8 was rebuilt in time to roar north fora summer\nroad trip to points unknown. A faint smile spreads across Mooney’s face as\nhe remembers the old car. “It had a nice noise to it,” he says. “It\npurred.”\n\nThat can-do spirit carried the day with the three-way catalytic converter\ntoo.\n\nIt inspired his boss and co-inventor at Engelhard, a scientist named Carl\nKeith, to send him around the world in the early ’70s to convince\nautomakers to add an oxygen sensor to their engines. The sensor would\nmonitor the fuel-to-air ratio so each engine could be tuned to the sweet\nspot where Mooney’s one-stage converter would work.\n\nVolvo listened first, and by 1976, the device was rolling off some of its\nassembly lines. Just about every automaker would soon follow suit.\n\nThe results are legendary. BASF says the three-way catalytic converter has\ndestroyed more than a billion tons of nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, and\nhydrocarbons since it was released. More impressive: To protect the device\nfrom damage, highly poisonous lead has been removed from gasoline in\nnearly every country.\n\n“It’s really an amazing thing that’s been created,” says MECA’s Kubsh.\n\nMooney breathes, sucking in fresh, clean air. He couldn’t agree more.\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'The Clean Air Catalyst'\npublication: 'Seton Hall Magazine'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},387:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Adventures in State Bailouts",publication:"Slate",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nTwo months after being laid off by Forbes, I discovered New York's Self\nEmployment Assistance Program. The problem was getting the state itself to\ndiscover it.\n\nThe program is offered by New York to help entrepreneurs launch new\nbusinesses while refunding tax dollars (the state calls them unemployment\nbenefits). I learned of it on the 14th page of an instruction manual that\nwas sent to me when I applied for unemployment.\n\nThe SEAP program sounded like a good deal to help me launch myself as a\nWeb video news anchor covering media news. It's been my beat for a while.\nI felt good about it. This is the era of government bailouts and stimulus\npackages, after all. I couldn't know that my first significant interaction\nwith government would lead me on a series of adventures involving baffled\nstate employees and a constant sense of amazement.\n\nI had my first adventure with New York on a Thursday afternoon in\nmid-March. I called the number listed for SEAP and learned the state had\ncreated the world's premier choose-your-own-adventure series using a voice\nmail messaging system. There was a dizzying array of options to choose\nfrom, each one leading to more options. It had no end. I cycled past level\nafter level about filing new claims, frequently asked questions, and how\npart-time work affects benefits.\n\nI hung up once, redialed, and started again (I had gotten lost), and just\nwhen I had lost hope, I met Charles. He had to go ask his manager about\nSEAP. I waited on the phone until he came back to explain I had to go to\nan unemployment office to apply. Once there, I would be given a quiz, and\nmy answers would be scored to see if I qualified. Charles then gave me two\naddresses, one in Midtown Manhattan and the other in Harlem.\n\nThe next day, I set off for 247 W. 54th St. to take my quiz. That's when I\nexperienced my second adventure. Charles had sent me to a hole in the\nground. It was a massive two-story pit that stretched along one-third of\nthe block. To clarify, that's three full-length buildings. I did the only\nthing I could. I tried calling a new number in the instruction manual for\nhelp.\n\nA man at Manhattan's Board of Elections picked up and promptly hung up on\nme when I insisted he not give me the automated phone number for the\nDepartment of Labor that I'd tried on Thursday. He didn't seem to know or\ncare about SEAP.\n\nThen I tried a police station near the hole. The precinct gave me a\ntelephone number that was disconnected. The automated message instructed\nme to call a third number, which is how I came to talk to someone at the\nDepartment of Labor's fraud division. It was early afternoon.\n\nUnemployment: That building was knocked down two years ago.\nMe: So it seems.\n\nUnemployment: Who sent you there? Me: Your office—the Department of Labor\nin Albany—yesterday afternoon.\n\nUnemployment: Who?\nMe: Charles.\nUnemployment: Charles? What was his last name?\nMe: I didn't ask.\nUnemployment: Why not?\nMe: I didn't think he'd send me to an empty lot.\n\nThere was a pause. Not only had the woman never heard of SEAP, but she\nclearly doubted it existed. Apparently, no one ever used it to defraud New\nYork state. That would have made me feel good if I hadn't begun doubting\nwhether anyone ever used it. Eventually, she gave me some more Department\nof Labor offices and phone numbers in New York City. None of them matched\nCharles'.\n\nFor some reason, I decided to give him another shot. What were the chances\nof being sent to two holes? On Monday morning, prepared for my third\nadventure, I trekked back to the West Side and up to 215 W. 125th St.\nWorkforce (that's what New York calls the unemployment division) was on\nthe sixth floor. The receptionist behind the counter was very friendly. I\nasked for SEAP, prepared to explain what it was. \"Oh, SEAP! You have to\ncome back on Friday at 10. That's when we do that.\"\n\nI looked at her. Then I told her I'd just been sent to an empty lot on\nFriday. \"Would you like to talk to someone about that?\" she asked. Why,\nyes, I would. \"Just have a seat and wait for the next Workforce\norientation session. Afterward you can talk to a manager.\" I left.\n\nI was back on Friday at 9:30 a.m. The receptionist was delighted that I\nwas so early. At a quarter to 10, Simone emerged from the back and called\nmy name. I could just feel that this was to be my final adventure with New\nYork state. Surely, victory was at hand. As we walked to her desk, she\nexplained she only did SEAP at 10 and didn't normally start early. I\nthanked her. The office was a beehive of activity—it looked like the\ntrading floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Workers were everywhere,\ntalking with one another excitedly about how to get people back to work. I\nfelt really good about my taxes.\n\nSimone explained SEAP as we walked. It sounded nothing like Charles'\ndescription. I would fill out a paper form at her desk that she would\nsubmit to Albany. If I was lucky, that form would trigger an invitation\nthat would be mailed to me within the next two weeks. I should then attend\none of the regular orientation meetings for SEAP, where I would be given a\nfolder. In the folder would be an application, which I should fill out and\nsubmit to Albany. At some point—Simone didn't know when—I'd receive word\nif I qualified. I'd have to wait to start my media business until after\nthis process was complete. I smiled and thanked her. I left and prepared\nto go it alone.\n\nPostscript: Two weeks later, I got a letter in the mail about SEAP. I was\ninvited to attend an orientation meeting on April 27. Following the\ninvitation was a note: \"One of the criteria to qualify for SEAP is a\nworker re-employment score of 70 or higher. Your score is 66.\"\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Adventures in State Bailouts'\npublication: 'Slate'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},388:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Charting an East/West Passage",publication:"The Darden Report",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nIn both the East and the West, it was hard to believe the story.\n\nAt a factory in Shenzen, China, at least 14 workers killed themselves in 2010. The factory, owned by Foxconn, produces iPads and iPhones for Apple and computers for Dell and Hewlett-Packard. By most accounts, the manufacturers’ unrelenting production demands had triggered the spate of\nsuicides.\n\nSo, who’s responsible? The Western companies, who rely increasingly on\nEastern contractors to produce their products for low wages and low\nprices? Or the Eastern manufacturer, whose plant managers and workers face\nincredible pressure to meet ambitious deadlines?\n\nIn his strategic management course “Strategic Thinking: Integrating East\nand West” this past spring, Darden School of Business Professor Ming-Jer\nChen asked his students to opine on the issue.\n\n“Chinese managers are shifting to the Western culture of produce,\nproduce, produce,” said Kristyn Kelly of the Class of 2011. “It’s the sort\nof hyper-productivity that only works if people are ready, willing and\nable to say ‘no.’” But Kelly says many Asians — long accustomed to rigid\nhierarchies — simply won’t say no. This time, the cultural clash appeared to have contributed to the tragedy.\n\nThe Foxconn case spotlights the challenges Eastern and Western managers\nface as they blend their businesses.\n\nAnd Chen is the perfect person to steer the conversation.\n\nA New Discipline\n\nChen’s work and life focus on balance. He grew up in Taitung on the\nsoutheast coast of Taiwan. As a youth, he studied philosophy and the\nChinese classics with a cousin of Puyi, “The Last Emperor” of China. In\n1981, Chen emigrated to the United States with a visionary quest: to “make\nthe world smaller.”\n\nBefore joining the Darden faculty in 2001, he was a professor at Columbia\nBusiness School and was founding director of the Global Chinese Business\nInitiative at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nChen focuses on ways to help managers combine the cultures, to narrow the\nEast-West divide. “I very much consider myself an academic entrepreneur,”\nsays Chen. And he’s a rather bold one. This summer, the management\nprofessor will blaze a new trail.\n\nAs vice president and program chair of the Academy of Management, Chen —\nwho will assume presidency of the group in 2012 — at this year’s annual\nconference intends to ask business scholars from around the world to study\nEastern and Western management techniques. His goal: find ways to\ncharacterize and quantify their di erences so executives can incorporate\nthe best — and avoid the worst — of each.\n\n“Ming-Jer has put his finger on a very important question,” says Jan\nRivkin, the Bruce V. Rauner professor and chair of Harvard Business\nSchool’s strategy unit. “Can a superior model of management emerge from\ncombining the best of both worlds?”\n\nThe academy conference should help Chen and his colleagues around the\nglobe find an answer. In August, the meeting will host more than 11,000 of\nthe organization’s 19,000 members. Among its ranks, the 75-year-old group\ncounts some of the world’s top scholars. For five days, they’ll meet in\nSan Antonio, Texas, to discuss the theme “West Meets East: Enlightening,\nBalancing and Transcending.”\n\nThe topic’s timing may be just right. “The United States still has the\nbest business system, but the system has also shown its vulnerability,”\nexplains Chen.\n\nIn 2008, a period of financial chicanery abruptly ended when the bubble it\ncreated in the U.S. housing market popped. Many still feel the e ects of\nthe recession that followed its explosion.\n\n“Because the economies in the West are soft, there are Westerners moving\nhere,” says Darden alumnus Peabody Hutton (MBA/JD ’77), general counsel of\nAjia Partners, a Hong Kong investment firm. Hutton says that for American\nAsians to set up shop on Eastern shores is not uncommon.\n\nThat’s one reason Chen thinks the market is ready to formally expand its\nhorizons.\n\nHe may be right. Harvard’s Rivkin leads the academy committee that\ndecides which sessions to feature during the annual meeting’s full-day\n“All-Academy Theme” program. Proposals have ranged from whether Asian\nbusiness schools should follow a Western model to yoga’s impact on an\norganization’s e ectiveness.\n\nThe variety of the proposed topics suggests that people may be ready for\nnew ideas. “For a long time, there was an assumption that Western\nmanagement was good management,” Rivkin says.\n\nThat may be changing, but can still be a hard sell.\n\nDefining the Eastern Paradox\n\nEasterners and Westerners think di erently.\nThe Foxconn suicides were a somber reminder of that. Yet\n\nthese di erences are often expressed more subtly than through questions\nabout workers’ rights.\n\n“Business [here] tends to be conducted less on the basis of merit and\nprice than on the basis of relationships,” says Ajia’s Hutton. The results\ncan be unpredictable.\n\nTo help explain the cultural nuances, Chen has lately been publishing\nabout an idea he calls “transparadox.”\n\nIt’s designed to o er Westerners a new way to think about ideas that\nappear to contradict each other but which may be two sides of the same\ncoin. In essence, transparadox proposes that notions that appear to be\noppositional — such as competition and cooperation — are interrelated or\neven interdependent, connected by a series of implicit links. Chen seeks\nto bridge a fundamental philosophical difference between the way\nEasterners and Westerners regard paradox. “By making these links\nexplicit,” says Chen, “we can enhance a mutual understanding that di\nerences are not irreconcilable.”\n\n“The Chinese are used to ambiguity,” says Hutton. Chen says there are\nplenty of reasons for Westerners to get used to it, and\n\nmoney is a big one.\nTraditionally, a corporation’s finances were managed at its\n\nWestern headquarters, says Leslie Grayson, professor emeritus of\ninternational business at Darden for whom Chen’s academic chair is named.\nToday, funds may move between foreign territories without passing\nthrough the West.\n\nAs a result, Easterners and Westerners have good reason to adapt to one\nanother.\n\n“If you don’t learn, there’s a penalty,” says Grayson. “You fail.”\nMeasuring Ambiculturality\n\nGiven their philosophical di erences, how do Easterners and Westerners\nsuccessfully combine their management strategies?\n\nThe answer could become one of Chen’s biggest hits. Last November, he\npublicly coined a term that may ultimately define not only this summer’s\nacademy conference but also the study of Eastern and Western management as\na whole: ambicultural.\n\nIt reads like intellectual popcorn. Say it aloud and ideas like\nambidexterity and cultural sensitivity come easily to mind. “The basic\npremise is that each culture in society has its own strengths and\nweaknesses when they’re applied to business practices,” Chen explains.\nCombining the best parts of each approach is ambicultural.\n\nBut this involves a trick. Strengths cannot be combined and weaknesses\navoided until they’ve been defined. So the professor is creating a survey\nto be sent to Eastern and Western managers later this year that he thinks\nwill do just that.\n\nFor instance, the survey may ask executives to rate the importance they\nplace on personal connections, and to numerically prioritize their\ninterest in employees, stakeholders and society.\n\n“I think there will be many di erent ways we can quantify the variables\nthat can reveal how ambicultural a company is,” Chen says. Already, he\nhopes to create a scale for companies to rate their use of cross-cultural\nmanagement strategies.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time Chen has developed a way to quantify the\nseemingly unquantifiable. In the mid-1980s, he spent months analyzing a\ndatabase of airline industry events that were covered by the trade\nnewspaper Aviation Daily. Thousands of articles were scored against\nvariables, such as “event visibility” or “response announcement speed,”\nthat Chen helped pioneer as a way to study airline competition over an\neight-year period.\n\nThe database made the competitive patterns that businesses fall into clear\nenough to study — and often, to predict.\n\nThe result: A popular new area of strategic theory named competitive\ndynamics emerged over the past 25 years in the management field and\ncontinues to thrive today. Competitive dynamics is the analysis of\ncompetition at the action and response level to predict how a firm will\nact or react toward opponents.\n\nAn Eastern or Western Face?\nAll the signs suggest “ambicultural” will be as big a hit.\n\nThe concept is not even a year old, yet management expertsare already\nstarting to buzz about it.\n\nIn March, an Asian edition of the Harvard Business Review\n\ntranslated the word into Chinese. Now, the editors of the U.S. edition are\ntalking to Chen about producing their own story on it. And next year, many\nbusiness students will study the term in the new edition of a well-known\ntextbook on strategic management.\n\nThe word’s surging popularity isn’t surprising. People are hungry for ways\nto sail between the East and West more easily.\n\n“Right now, what we need to do is to compare management systems from one\ncountry [against those of] another country,” says Grayson.\n\nThe hard part is doing that without judging the results harshly. Consider\njob interviews. Grayson says that rather than just examining competence,\nAsian companies focus on learning “who” they are considering hiring. This\nmay entail asking questions some Western countries deem illegal, such as\nwhether the candidate is married or plans on having children.\n\nChen’s ideas can’t solve legal problems like those, but they may help\nmanagers bridge the cultural chasm underlying them. Still, it’s a big task\n— certainly too big for one man to perform alone, and the strategy expert\nhas no intention of trying to do so single-handedly. Rather, his plan is\nto work through the Academy of Management to expose his colleagues to a\nframework they can use to study it on their own. The approach already\nseems to be working.\n\nDarden student Kelly — who worked for the U.S. Navy before coming to\nDarden and studying Foxconn with Chen — says he opened her eyes to the\nEast.\n\n“We’re still viewing China through a Western lens,” she says. “We’re not\nviewing the Chinese as partners.”\n",frontmatter:"headline: 'Charting an East/West Passage'\npublication: 'The Darden Report'\nposition: 'Freelance'"}},389:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{headline:"Is the Wine Trade Recession-Proof?",publication:"The Darden Report",position:"Freelance"},body:"\nNO ONE GOT A CHANCE to put away the crate of Tignanello when it first\narrived at Young’s Fine Wines. Its six \\$109 bottles of wine barely had a\nchance to rest on the Manhasset, New York storeroom floor. Two hours\nlater, every bottle had been bought. That was two years ago, long before\nthe pain of recession set into people’s minds.\n\nThese days, Young’s wealthy Long Island clientele of Wall Street bankers\nand Madison Avenue advertising executives aren’t so quick to spend so big.\nThat’s why the store is pushing wines ranging in price from $15 to \\$25\nfrom a huge stock that regularly runs over 3,000 bottles. “At some point,\npeople are going to buy less,” said Young’s President Edward Wassmer (TEP\n’95).\n\nWithout a doubt, the recession has sharpened the senses and tightened the\nwallets of almost everyone. Like Wassmer, people throughout the wine trade\nare struggling to find ways to maintain sales without just slashing\nprices. While some markets, such as luxury clothing, have already moved to\nmassive discounts in the face of an economizing public, the wine industry\nhopes it can buck the trend—or at least embrace it slowly.\n\n“People are going to continue to drink. I think it’s one of our national\npastimes, isn’t it?” asked Gene Meoni, general manager of hospitality for\nthe Darden School Foundation, which includes a pub and a 300-seat dining\nroom. Recent sales at wine retailers suggest he’s right. They increased by 4.9 percent year-over-year to $8.2 billion for the 52 weeks ending January 10 (which includes the lucrative holiday season), according to Nielsen Scantrak. Indeed, for the four weeks ending January 10—just after the recession became official—retail sales grew 7.6 percent to \\$810 million.\n\nStill, pressure remains high to retain a big cut of those numbers.\n“Everybody can dance around it, but retailers want sharply reduced\nprices,” said Jack Kennard (MBA ’73), a senior vice president at Brown-Forman, one of the largest producers of wine and spirits in the world.\nKennard argues that giving into widespread and deep price reductions is a\nmistake that will permanently undermine a business’s product and a brand’s\nhealth. “Deep discounting is highly destructive to brand equity over the\nlong term,” he said.\n\nAs of early February, Brown-Forman was resisting deep price cuts. Instead,\nthe company was enticing sales by developing limited-time marketing\nprograms geared toward adding value at the point of purchase. For example,\nsome wines now include stemware boxed in gift sets, and the company is\ncreating more attractive gift cards and packaging to encourage sales.\nWhether people will buy the strategy for long is hard to say, as no one\nknows just how bad the economy will get—or when it will get better.\n\nOne thing is already clear, though— cheaper is better as far as consumers\nare concerned. Nielsen reports that the $3.00 – \\$5.99 category of wine\nbottles saw the strongest year-over-year growth at 12.9 percent to \\$189\nmillion for the four weeks ending January 10. Yet wines costing \\$15 or\nmore grew only 3.7 percent to \\$120 million during the same period. Indeed,\nthat was the only price range to shrink last fall as the economic strength\nof the U.S. plummeted, dropping 0.5 percent to \\$311 million over the 13\nweeks ending January 10.\n\nWithout a doubt, premium wines are in a tough spot. Judith Fowler (MBA\n’81), owner of the Clevedon, New Zealand– based winery Puriri Hills, knows\nthat only too well. With just 12,000 bottles of wine coming out of her\nwinery a year, Fowler agrees that cutting the price of her three labels,\nwhich range from $25 to \\$150 in the U.S., is a bad idea. “The price point\nhas to say something about quality,” she said. A strategy of massive price\ndiscounting is incompatible with the small volumes produced.\n\nThough the pressure is on, the 13-year- old winery is standing behind its\nconviction that “handmade, estate-bottled wines such as ours are becoming\nmore desirable as people shift from industrially produced foods to\nartisanal foods, even in the current tough market environment.” Puriri\nHills views the recession as an opportunity to grow within its market\nsegment, and the winery has found some palatable ways to inspire sales.\nLate last year, Fowler began giving some distributors price breaks or\ncredits for local taxes to help keep them in business to sell her cases.\n\n“You have to encourage your middle men in this kind of a time,” she said.\nFor instance, Fowler did not raise prices on a distributor in one Asian\nmarket whose native currency strengthened as much as 50 percent in the\nlast year against the New Zealand dollar. Though the distributor is e\nectively paying half as much for the same goods, keeping him on has helped\nPuriri Hills maintain and create sales in a tough environment.\n\nThose same currency fluctuations may also help Puriri Hills increase its\ndistribution. The New Zealand dollar has weakened by as much as 40 percent\nagainst the U.S. dollar in the last year, so Fowler is now looking into\nselling her wines in the U.S., in states beyond her native Virginia. As of\nFebruary, she was talking with her son—who distributes Puriri Hills in the\nU.S.—about selling them in New York City and Chicago. “You look for the\nspecific place where the customers want something unusual,” she said.\n\nShe may be on to something at a time when bars and restaurants are already\nstruggling to keep business up, said Darden’s Meoni. Wine sales are often\nan important component of their revenues because of what can be an\nextremely high markup on each bottle. But with people spending carefully,\nMeoni said both groups are thirsty for unusual labels from places such as\nNew Zealand that can sustain a similar markup at a lower price than super-high premium wines. “There’s a lot of stu that isn’t mainstream that is a very, very good value,” he said.\n\nStill, there is a strong demand for cheaper wines. That’s a big reason\nPleasant Valley Wine Company President Mike Doyle (MBA ’66) said business\nis booming right now. While the winery sells some of its own labels, much\nof its business comes from producing wines for third parties whose bottles\ngenerally run less than $20. “This is usually a slow time of year, and we’re pretty busy,” said Doyle. In fact, there are more opportunities than he can keep up with at the moment. And why not—he said most people can’t tell the difference between a \\$25 and a \\$125 bottle of Merlot.\n\nBrown-Forman’s Kennard doesn’t entirely agree. The “trade-down” effect,\nas the industry likes to call it, is only temporary, he said. By shying\naway from expensive wines and spirits, people aren’t casting a vote\nagainst the premium brands they’ve been loyal to for many years. “They\njust simply feel it’s not right for them right now as they attempt to\neconomize,” he said. “Luxury brands are ‘worn’ by consumers like badges,\nand premium sector wine and spirits consumers look forward rather\nhopefully to better times when they will confidently express themselves\nthrough luxury brands again.”\n\nWassmer of Young’s Fine Wines echoes the sentiment, but said these days he\nneeds to go with the flow. Despite strong sales in 2007, he decided it was\ntime to plan for a recession two years ago. Wall Street’s violent\nreactions to small slips in sales were one reason why. “You could see\npeople with just a little bit of softness were in a scramble,” he said. So\nhe cut back buying some popular—and pricey—vintages.\n\nAnd he did something curious: he started hiring. With some wine\ndiscounters nearby, competing on price alone was unlikely without a lot of\nattention to service and selection. “There’s really no way to e ectively\nsell that many items [over 3,000 bottles], but put out ‘shelf talkers’ to\nget the job done,” said Wassmer. Last year, he boosted the sales sta from\none full time person and two part-timers to three full time people and one\npart-timer, and developed a nine-week training course for them known as\n“Young’s U.”\n\nThere are early signs it’s working. An increase in customer count in\nJanuary—a traditionally weak month—of 11 percent to 7,684 people helped\ncushion a drop in sales of roughly one percent.

It's a browser-testing platform. You give it a URL, it takes a screenshot on whatever machine and browser you specify. I got a test running — one of their free ones. I liked the results, but Endtest wants $138 per month for the platform. Not for me. \n\nSo I Googled competitors and settled on BrowserStack because I've heard of them, their product's comprehensive, and, frankly, I found the $39 a month (if you go monthly) palatable.

According to Google's guide to Web images, the best format for them is JPG. See the picture under [\"Selecting the right image format\"](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization).\n\nGoogle says that among rasters (files that encode color values for every pixel), JPG is great for images with few details and small color palettes.\n\nNow, let's look at practical reality. \n\nThe chapter icon (a filled-in circle image) is eight pixels by eight pixels and uses one color. This results in the following file sizes:\n\n* SVG (Inkscape): 2 kilobytes\n* SVG (Optimized): 722 bytes (Inkscape-specific data is stripped out)\n* JPG: 966 bytes (Exported from a PNG using the worst quality setting in a Mac's \"Preview\" app)\n* PNG: 674 bytes\n\nI went with PNG, obviously. \n\nSo, firstly, knowing what's best upfront may be clearer with more knowledge and experience. \n\nSecondly, look at the SVG. It uses plain English to describe how images should look (like HTML does for Web pages). Its two kilobytes no matter the image's size. If it got bigger, this format would be great becuse the file would still be two kilobytes. In this case, the image is fixed at eight pixels, so I don't think it matters. \n\nBut, here's the bottom line — \n\nWhen you factor all the variables in Google's article together, there's a lot of magic here. That's why my results don't follow the rules so well. It all comes down to trial and error.

I was fixing some overflowing header text on my iPhone SE. I practically screamed in public, banged some keys, and felt marginally better. \n\n\nThing was, I was almost done. I was tweaking design and getting production and development 'builds' in order. Basically, this means telling Webpack to generate different types of code based on the build type. Webpack 'bundles' javascript files together so a user's machine can run them.\n\nAnyway, in the middle of all this, my CSS stopped working. Or at least my ability to edit it on the fly did. Chrome just greyed out all the rules. Googling the problem was heartbreaking. Most commentary called it a stylesheet error. There's a workaround, but it's a hack. And, anyway, a portfolio site can't be broken.\n\nSo I started futzing about. First I created a bunch of new branches from old code (a branch is a complete set of folders, files, and code that represent my entire project at a given point in time). I hoped to find one where the CSS worked. \n\nDidn't. \n\nSo then I disabled most of my code and threw a plain box of text on screen. That worked, sorta, so I got suspicous of Styled Components.\n\nStyled Components is an open-source javascript project. It lets me write CSS rules directly inside my javascript, as opposed to putting them in a separate stylesheet. I started the site with one of these stylesheets. I spent half my time maintaining it — debugging it, making stuff work, getting lost inside it at some later date.\n\nI'd like to say I'll never do that again, but I'm sure lots of people still use stylesheets. And suffer. Anyway, I began Googling again for greyed out CSS rules in Chrome when using Styled Components. And I [found my diagnosis](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51544215/styled-component-styles-are-disabled-in-chrome-devtools).\n\nWhen in production mode, Styled Components create a type of CSS that can't be edited in Chrome. It can only be edited when in development mode. Remember what I said earlier, I'd been messing around with this very thing the last couple days. So, I changed some code — no joy. \n\nI changed more code — no joy.\n\nA lot of painful time went by before I had another brainstorm. I'm doing something really smart with my production build. I'm using a \"content delivery network\" (CDN) to deliver some of the site's dependencies, rather than bundling them all together into a package that I deliver. I'll explain why later (hint: bandwidth usage limits). \n\nPoint is, I told the CDN to deliver a production version of Styled Components. I hard coded it (which devs don't like for a reason). And that's my problem! \n\nLessons learned:\n\n1. Managing production and development builds requires thoughtfulness.\n2. Clever ideas may not be so clever (remember that scene at the end of \"Miracle on 34th Street\" when Fred Gailey sees Santa's cane?)\n3. Documentation tends to fall down when it comes to the fundamentals — I can't find this issue on the Styled Components site. If it's there, it's hard to find. I think it should be front-and-center in a \"Gotchas\" section.\n\nAnyway, there's more to say...but I think I've milked this for all it's worth.\n\n-j",frontmatter:"type: reverie\nheadline: When styles break\ndate: April 13, 2019\nslug: Styled components are unchangeable"}},396:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{type:"reverie",headline:"Virtual reality is light on reality, one",date:"April 17, 2019",slug:"Virtual machines may lie, really"},body:"\nWhite flag!\n\nBrowserStack says my design is breaking on some old machines. It took a long time, but I finally realized that a second hidden scrollbar is being added to an element that allows uers to scroll content too long for the page. This creates an ugly gap, and brings up two questions: \n\n1. Are virtual machines always true to reality?\n2. Does React always understand what browsers are doing?\n\nNow, I don't know anything much about anything much. Worse, sometimes I find out that I'm wrong. But I'm pretty sure the answer is no, no, it depends, and, at least occasionally, no. Always cover your bets.\n\nI. Are virtual machines always true to reality?\n\nA virtual machine allows you to run an entire computer that isn't yours on top of your computer. So, for example, I can run Windows XP in a virtual machine while also running OS X on my Mac.\n\nThis allows me to test a lot of browsers without spending bazillions on equipment. I'm not doing this directly. BrowserStack has made a whole bunch of virtual machines for me. That's what $39/month gets you.\n\nSo the question is, can I trust what these machines are telling me about my site's design? Most of the time, \"yes,\" but not always.\n\nProof, right? \n\nAfter seeing my layout problem on a range of Mac OS and Windows machines, I used a virtual machine to run Chrome 73 on Mac OS X High Sierra. \n\nSure enough, my layout problem reared its ugly head.\n\nExcept— my real-life computer is a Macbook Air running OS X High Sierra and Chrome 73. There's no layout problem. Let me say that again.\n\nNONE. ZERO. ZILCH!\n\nMethinks the virtual machine doth protest too much. Hard to tell because I can't buy all these machines to test them. Still, the world's funny: I had the original Macbook Air and I remember reading that Apple built a special version of OS X for it, which came with its own quirks.\n\nMaybe it's the same situation here, my 13'ers little quirk.\n\nBut...I've noticed a number of oddities with virtual machines, so I can believe they get it wrong sometimes. (Part two has more on why.)\n\nTime'll tell.\n\n-j\n",frontmatter:"type: reverie\nheadline: Virtual reality is light on reality, one\ndate: April 17, 2019\nslug: Virtual machines may lie, really"}},397:function(e,t){e.exports={attributes:{type:"reverie",headline:"Virtual reality is light on reality, two",date:"April 18, 2019",slug:"React lies too sometimes"},body:"\nLet's talk React now that I've decided that virtual machines aren't always right.\n\nII. Does React always understand what browsers are doing?\n\nReact is a free javascript framework from Facebook that makes it easy for Web developers to build very slick software. It lets them use javascript to generate HTML and update it in real time as users interact with their programs. \n\nReact comes with a lot of opinions about how to program software.\n\n(It comes with an army of people who have equally strong opinions about that too. I'll belabor the whole thing as soon as I know enough to have an opinion about why it's so horrible to have an opinion.)\n\nAnyway, people refer to React's opinions as \"the React way.\" \n\nSticking to it seems to be a good idea. Fighting it often leads to trouble. \n\nSitll, the React way isn't always good enough. That's where \"refs\" come in. \n\nReact's official documentation calls \"refs\" an \"escape hatch.\" They offer a way to look under React's hood. \n\nBasically, React sits between your code and the Web page people see on screen. The page is React's shadow. Kinda makes sense — React calculates values, then uses them to \"paint\" results to screen (really, the browser) when done.\n\nProblem is, the ref represents what React knows BEFORE painting.\n\nLet's use Internet Explorer 11 on Windows XP as an example. \n\nAccording to IE 11 developer tools, my overflow element has an empty gap of 17px between the content and the scroll bar. This gap is the expected width of an IE11 scroll bar. Basically, IE (and a bunch of other browsers) is adding space for a second scroll bar. (It's empty space, no scroll bar, just space for one.)\n\nAfter pecking about, I realized I could get rid of it by checking to see if the gap existed via the following equation: \n\n    if (mainElementRefWidth > overflowRefWidth) {\n        25 - (mainElementRefWidth - overflowRefWidth) = 17 (or whatever)\n    }\n\nEasy peasy! Um. But. OK... \n\nI added \"refs\" to of my elements, then checked their width via .offsetWidth and .getBoundingClientRect().width. Unfortunately, they both report that the offending element has the right width. \n\nI can see this isn't true when I look at the screen and the computed width of the element in developer tools. \n\nSo what gives?!\n\nRemember the \"paint\" I mentioned earlier? That gives.\n\nReact generates HTML behind the scenes before painting it to screen. The width is right at the time of generation. Problem is, React doesn't seem to see what happens AFTER it paints. React doesn't know about this, though.\n\nI realized this while perusing Stack Overflow. A guy with a similar issue asked, and even linked to a React team issue on Github talking about it. It was suggested that he check element width after calling requestAnimationFrame(), a built-in browser function that runs AFTER HTML the browser paints elements to screen.\n\n(React paints, then, I think, the browser paints. Everyone likes the word \"paint.\")\n\nThis delay ought to let me get the true width (the one with the gap). \n\nIf only. I still got the wrong number. (My eyes still tell me it's wrong.) \n\nAt this point, I tried a whole of bunch things. The long and short it is that the best I could do was an unstable fix. It worked in some virtualized browsers, but not others, and the problem wasn't always React.\n\nGiven the last post's virtualization question, I've decided to chalk this up to a virtualization bug. After four days of work, I now believe in ghosts.\n\nWho you gonna call?\n\n-j\n",frontmatter:"type: reverie\nheadline: Virtual reality is light on reality, two\ndate: April 18, 2019\nslug: React lies
